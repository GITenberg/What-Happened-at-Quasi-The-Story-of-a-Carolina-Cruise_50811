<p class="pch">INTERSTATE CHUMMING</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was hot in Charleston&mdash;intensely hot&mdash;with
not a breath of air in motion anywhere. The glossy
leaves of the magnolia trees in the grounds that surrounded
the Rutledge house drooped despairingly
in the withering, scorching, blistering sunlight of a
summer afternoon in the year 1886. The cocker
spaniel in the courtyard panted with tongue out, between
the dips he took at brief intervals in the
water-vat provided for his use. A glance down
King Street showed no living creature, man or beast,
astir in Charleston’s busiest thoroughfare.</p>

<p>In the upper verandah of the Rutledge mansion,
four boys, as lightly dressed as propriety permitted,
were doing their best to keep endurably cool
and three of them were succeeding. The fourth
was making a dismal failure of the attempt. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
was Richard Wentworth of Boston, and he naturally
knew little of the arts by which the people of
hot climates manage to endure torrid weather with
tolerable comfort and satisfaction. He kept his
blood excited by the exertion of violently fanning
himself. While the others sat perfectly still in
bamboo chairs, or lay motionless on joggling boards,
Dick Wentworth was constantly stirring about in
search of a cooler place which he did not find.</p>

<p>Presently he went for the fourth or fifth time to
the end of the porch, where he could see a part of
the street by peering through the great green jalousies
or slatted shutters that barred out the fierce
sunlight.</p>

<p>“What do you do that for, Dick?” asked Lawrence
Rutledge in a languid tone and without lifting
his head from the head-rest of the joggling
board.</p>

<p>“What do I do what for?” asked Dick in return.</p>

<p>“Why run to the end of the verandah every
five minutes? What do you do it for? Don’t you
know it’s hot? Don’t you realize that violent exertion
like that is unfit for weather like this? Why,
I regard unnecessary winking as exercise altogether
too strenuous at such a time, and so I don’t open
my eyes except in little slits, and I do even that only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
when I must. You see, I’m doing my best to keep
cool, while you are stirring about all the time and
fretting and fuming in a way that would set a kettle
boiling. Why do you do it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m only observing, in a strange land,” answered
Dick, sinking into a wicker chair. “I’ll be
quiet, now that I have found out the facts.”</p>

<p>“What are they, Dick?” asked Tom Garnett,
otherwise known to his companions as “the Virginia
delegation,” he being the only Virginian in
the group. “What have you found out?”</p>

<p>“Only that the cobblestones, with which the
street out there is paved, have been vulcanized, just
as dentists treat rubber mouth plates. Otherwise
they would melt.”</p>

<p>“I’d laugh at that joke, Dick, if I dared risk the
exertion,” drawled Calhoun Rutledge, the fourth
boy in the group, and Lawrence Rutledge’s twin
brother. “Ah, there it comes!” he exclaimed,
rolling off his joggling board and busying himself
with turning the broad slats of the jalousies so as to
admit the cool sea breeze that had set in with the
turning of the tide.</p>

<p>Lawrence&mdash;or “Larry”&mdash;Rutledge did the
same, and Tom Garnett slid out of his bamboo chair,
stretched himself and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Well, that <i>is</i> a relief!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick Wentworth sat still, not realizing the sudden
change until a stiff breeze streaming in through
the blinds blew straight into his face, bearing with
it a delicious odor from the cape jessamines that
grew thickly about the house. Then he rose and
hurried to an open lattice, quite as if he had expected
to discover there some huge bellows or some
gigantic electric fan stirring the air into rapid motion.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” he asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Nothing, except that the tide has turned,” answered
Larry.</p>

<p>“But the breeze? Where does that come
from?”</p>

<p>“From the sea. It always comes in with the
flood-tide, and we’ve been waiting for it. Pull on
your coat or stand out of the draught; the sudden
change might give you a cold.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t have to melt for whole days
at a time, but get a little relief like this, now and
then?”</p>

<p>“We don’t melt at all. We don’t suffer half as
much from hot weather as the people of northern
cities do&mdash;particularly New York.”</p>

<p>“But why not, if you have to undergo a grilling
like this every day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“It doesn’t happen every day, or anything like
every day. It never lasts long and we know how
to endure it.”</p>

<p>“How? I’m anxious to learn. I may be put
on the broiler again and I want to be prepared.”</p>

<p>“Well, we begin by recognizing facts and meeting
them sensibly. It is always hot here in the sun,
during the summer months, and so we don’t go
out into the glare during the torrid hours. From
about eleven till four o’clock nobody thinks of quitting
the coolest, shadiest place he can find, while
in northern cities those are the busiest hours of the
day, even when the mercury is in the nineties. We
do what we have to do in the early forenoon and
the late afternoon. During the heat and burden
of the day we keep still, avoiding exertion of every
kind as we might shun pestilence or poison. The
result is that sun strokes and heat prostrations are
unknown here, while at the north during every hot
spell your newspapers print long columns of the
names of persons who have fallen victims.”</p>

<p>“Then again,” added Calhoun, “we build for hot
weather while you build to meet arctic blasts. We
set our houses separately in large plots of ground,
while you pack yours as close together as possible.
We provide ourselves with broad verandahs and
bury ourselves in shade, while you are planning your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
heating apparatus and doubling up your window
sashes to keep the cold out.”</p>

<p>“It distresses me sorely,” broke in Larry, “to
interrupt an interesting discussion to which I have
contributed all the wisdom I care to spare, but the
sun is more than half way down the western slope
of the firmament, and if we are to get the dory into
the water this afternoon it is high time for us to be
wending our way through Spring Street to the
neighborhood of Gadsden’s Green&mdash;so called, I
believe, because some Gadsden of ancient times intended
it to become green.”</p>

<p>The four boys had been classmates for several
years in a noted preparatory school in Virginia.
Dick Wentworth had been sent thither four years
before for the sake of his threatened health. He
had quickly grown strong again in the kindly climate
of Virginia, but in the meanwhile he had
learned to like his school and his schoolmates, particularly
the two Rutledges and the Virginia boy,
Tom Garnett. He had therefore remained at the
school throughout the preparatory course.</p>

<p>Their school days were at an end now, all of
them having passed their college entrance examinations;
but they planned to be classmates still, all attending
the same university at the North.</p>

<p>They were to spend the rest of the summer vacation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
together, with the Charleston home of the
Rutledge boys for their base of operations, while
campaigning for sport and adventure far and wide
on the coast.</p>

<p>That accounted for the dory. No boat of that
type had ever been seen on the Carolina coast, but
Larry and Cal Rutledge had learned to know its
cruising qualities while on a visit to Dick Wentworth
during the summer before, and this year
their father had given them a dory, specially built to
his order at Swampscott and shipped south by a
coasting steamer.</p>

<p>When she arrived, she had only a priming coat
of dirty-looking white paint upon her, and the boys
promptly set to work painting her in a little boathouse
of theirs on the Ashley river side of the city.
The new paint was dry now and the boat was ready
to take the water.</p>

<p>“She’s a beauty and no mistake,” said Cal as the
group studied her lines and examined her rather
elaborate lockers and other fittings.</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s all that,” responded his brother,
“and we’ll try her paces to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Not if she’s like all the other dories I’ve had
anything to do with,” answered Dick. “She’s been
out of water ever since she left her cradle, and it’ll
take some time for her to soak up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, of course she’ll leak a little, even after a
night in the water,” said Cal, with his peculiar drawl
which always made whatever he said sound about
equally like a mocking joke and the profoundest
philosophy. “But who minds getting his feet wet
in warm salt water?”</p>

<p>“Leak a little?” responded Dick; “leak a little?
Why, she’ll fill herself half full within five
minutes after we shove her in, and if we get into
her to-morrow morning the other half will follow
suit. It’ll take two days at least to make her seams
tight.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t the caulkers put more oakum into
her seams, then?” queried Tom, whose acquaintance
with boats was very scant. “I should think they’d
jam and cram every seam so full that the boat would
be water tight from the first.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they would,” languidly drawled Cal,
“if they knew no more about such things than you
do, Tom.”</p>

<p>“How much do you know, Cal?” sharply asked
the other.</p>

<p>“Oh, not much&mdash;not half or a quarter as much
as Dick does. But a part of the little that I know
is the fact that when you wet a dry, white cedar
board it swells, and the further fact that when you
soak dry oakum in water, it swells a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
more. It is my conviction that if a boat were
caulked to water tightness while she was dry and
then put into the water, the swelling would warp
and split and twist her into a very fair imitation of
a tall silk hat after a crazy mule has danced the
highland fling upon it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see, of course. But will she be really
tight after she swells up?”</p>

<p>“As tight as a drum. But we’ll take some
oakum along, and a caulking tool or two, and a pot
of white lead, so that if she gets a jolt of any kind
and springs a leak we can haul her out and repair
damages. We’ll take a little pot of paint, too, in one
of the lockers.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be time enough after supper,” interrupted
Larry, “to discuss everything like that, and
we must be prompt at supper, too, for you know
father is to leave for the North to-night to meet
mother on Cape Cod and his ship sails at midnight.
So get hold of the boat, every fellow of you, and
let’s shove her in.”</p>

<p>The launching was done within a minute or two,
and after that the dory rocked herself to sleep&mdash;that’s
what Cal said.</p>

<p>“She’s certainly a beauty,” said Dick Wentworth.
“And of course she’s better finished and finer every
way than any dory I ever saw. You know, Tom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
dories up north are rough fishing boats. This one
is finished like a yacht, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s hunky dory,” answered Tom, lapsing
into slang.</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ll name her, then,” drawled
Cal. “She’s certainly ‘hunky’ and she’s a dory,
and if that doesn’t make her the <i>Hunkydory</i>, I’d
very much like to know what s-o-x spells.”</p>

<p>There was a little laugh all round. As the incoming
water floated the bottom boards, the name
of the boat was unanimously adopted, and after
another admiring look at her, the four hurried away
to supper. On the way Dick explained to Tom that
a dory is built for sailing or rowing in rough seas,
and running ashore through the surf on shelving
beaches.</p>

<p>“That accounts for the peculiar shape of her narrow,
flat bottom, her heavy overhang at bow and
stern, her widely sloping sides, and for the still odder
shape and set of her centre board and rudder. She
can come head-on to a beach, and as she glides up
the sloping sand it shuts up her centre board and lifts
her rudder out of its sockets without the least danger
of injuring either. In the water a dory is as nervous
as a schoolgirl in a thunder storm. The least
wind pressure on her sails or the least shifting of
her passengers or cargo, sends her heeling over almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to her beam ends, but she is very hard to capsize,
because her gunwales are so built out that they
act as bilge keels.”</p>

<p>“I’d understand all that a good deal better,”
answered Tom, laughing, “if I had the smallest
notion what the words mean. I have a vague idea
that I know what a rudder is, but when you talk
of centre boards, overhangs, gunwales, and bilge
keels, you tow me out beyond my depth.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Cal. “Wait till we get you
out on the water, you land lubber, and then Dick
can give you a rudimentary course of instruction
in nautical nomenclature. Just now there is neither
time nor occasion to think about anything but the
broiled spring chickens and plates full of rice that
we’re to have for supper, with a casual reflection
upon the okra, the green peas and the sliced tomatoes
that will escort them into our presence.”</p>

<p>In an aside to Dick Wentworth&mdash;but spoken
so that all could hear&mdash;Tom said:</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Cal can help talking that way.
I think if he were drowning he’d put his cries of
‘help’ into elaborate sentences.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, I should do precisely that,” answered
Cal. “Why not? Our thoughts are the children
of our brains, and I think enough of my brain-children
to dress them as well as I can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>In part, Cal’s explanation was correct enough.
But his habit of elaborate speech was, in fact, also
meant to be mildly humorous. This was especially
so when he deliberately overdressed his brain-children
in ponderous words and stilted phrases.</p>

<p>They were at the Rutledge mansion by this time,
however, and further chatter was cut off by a negro
servant’s announcement that “Supper’s ready an’
yo’ fathah’s a waitin’.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">II</h2>

<p class="pch">THE STORY OF QUASI</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Major Rutledge</span> entertained the boys at supper
with accounts of his own experiences along the
coast during the war, and incidentally gave them a
good deal of detailed information likely to be useful
to them in their journeyings. But he gave them no
instructions and no cautions. He firmly believed
that youths of their age and intelligence ought to
know how to take care of themselves, and that if
they did not it was high time for them to learn in
the school of experience. He knew these to be
courageous boys, manly, self-reliant, intelligent, and
tactful. He was, therefore, disposed to leave them
to their own devices, trusting to their wits to meet
any emergencies that might arise.</p>

<p>One bit of assistance of great value he did give
them, namely, a complete set of coast charts, prepared
by the government officials at Washington.</p>

<p>“You see,” he explained to the two visitors,
“this is a very low-lying coast, interlaced by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
tangled network of rivers, creeks, inlets, bayous,
and the like, so that in many places it is difficult
even for persons intimately familiar with its intricacies
to find their way. My boys know the geography
of it fairly well, but you’ll find they will have
frequent need to consult the charts. I’ve had them
encased in water-tight tin receptacles.”</p>

<p>“May I ask a question?” interjected Tom
Garnett, as he minutely scanned one of the charts.</p>

<p>“Certainly, as many as you like.”</p>

<p>“What do those little figures mean that are
dotted thickly all over the sheets?”</p>

<p>“They show the depth of water at every spot, at
mean high tide. You’ll find them useful&mdash;particularly
in making short cuts. You see, Tom, many
of the narrowest of our creeks are very deep, and
many broad bays very shallow in places. Besides,
there are mud banks scattered all about, some of
them under water all the time, others under it only
at high tide. You boys don’t want to get stuck on
them, and you won’t, if you study the figures on
your charts closely. By the way, Larry, how much
water does your boat draw?”</p>

<p>“Three feet, six inches, when loaded, with the
centre board down&mdash;six inches, perhaps, when
light, with the board up.”</p>

<p>“There, Tom, you see how easily the chart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
soundings may save you a lot of trouble. There
may be times when you can save miles of sailing
by laying your course over sunken sandbars if sailing
before the wind, though you couldn’t pass over
them at all if sailing on the wind.”</p>

<p>“But what difference does the way of sailing
make? You see, I am very ignorant, Major Rutledge.”</p>

<p>“You’ll learn fast enough, because you aren’t
afraid to ask questions. Now to answer your last
one; when you sail before the wind you’ll have no
need of your centre board and can draw it up, making
your draught only six or eight inches, while
on the wind you must have the centre board down&mdash;my
boys will explain that when you’re all afloat&mdash;so
if you are sailing with the wind dead astern,
or nearly so, it will be safe enough to lay a course
that offers you only two or three feet of water in its
shoalest parts, while if the wind is abeam, or in a
beating direction, you must keep your centre board
down and stick to deeper channels. However, the
boys will soon teach you all that on the journey.
They’re better sailors than I am.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to his own sons, he said:</p>

<p>“I have arranged with my bank to honor any
checks either of you may draw. So if you have
need of more money than you take with you, you’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
know how to get it. Any planter or merchant down
the coast will cash your checks for you. Now I
must say good-bye to all of you, as I have many
things to do before leaving. I wish all of you a
very jolly time.”</p>

<p>With that he quitted the room, but a few minutes
later he opened the door to say:</p>

<p>“If you get that far down the coast, boys, I
wish you would take a look over Quasi and see that
there are no squatters there.”</p>

<p>When he had gone, Cal said:</p>

<p>“Wonder if father hopes to win yet in that
Quasi matter, after all these years?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” answered Larry.
“Anyhow, we’ll go that far down, if only to gratify
his wish.”</p>

<p>“Is Quasi a town?” asked Dick, whose curiosity
was awakened by the oddity of the name.</p>

<p>“No. It’s a plantation, and one with a story.”</p>

<p>Dick asked no more questions, but presently Cal
said to his brother:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go on, Larry, and tell him all
about it? I have always been taught by my pastors
and masters, and most other people I have ever
known, that it is exceedingly bad manners to talk in
enigmas before guests. Besides, there’s no secret
about this. Everybody in South Carolina who ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
heard the name Rutledge knows all about Quasi.
Go on and tell the fellows, lest they think our family
has a skeleton in some one or other of its closets,
and is cherishing some dark, mysterious secret.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell it yourself, Cal? You
know the story as well as I do.”</p>

<p>“Because, oh my brother, it was your remark
that aroused the curiosity which it is our hospitable
duty to satisfy. I do not wish to trespass upon your
privileges or take your obligations upon myself.
Go on! There is harkening all about you. You
have your audience and your theme. We hang
upon your lips.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t much of a story, but I may as well
tell it,” said Larry, smiling at his brother’s ponderous
speech.</p>

<p>“Quasi is a very large plantation occupying the
end of a peninsula. Except on the mainland side a
dozen miles of salt water, mud banks and marsh
islands, separate it from the nearest land. On the
mainland side there is a marsh two or three miles
wide and a thousand miles deep, I think. At any
rate, it is utterly impassable&mdash;a mere mass of semi-liquid
mud, though it looks solid enough with its
growth of tall salt marsh grass covering its ugliness
and hiding its treachery. The point might as
well be an island, so far as possibilities of approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to it are concerned, and in effect it is an island, or
quasi an island. I suppose some humorous old
owner of it had that in mind when he named it
Quasi.</p>

<p>“It is sea island cotton land of the very finest
and richest kind, and when it was cultivated it was
better worth working than a gold mine. There are
large tracts of original timber on it, and as it has
been abandoned and running wild for more than
twenty years, even the young tree growths are
large and fine now.</p>

<p>“That is where the story begins. Quasi belonged
to our grandfather Rutledge. He didn’t
live there, but he had the place under thorough cultivation.
When the war broke out my grandfather
was one of the few men in the South who doubted
our side’s ability to win, and as no man could foresee
what financial disturbances might occur, he decided
to secure his two daughters&mdash;our father’s sisters,
who were then young girls&mdash;against all possibility
of poverty, by giving Quasi to them in their
own right. ‘Then,’ he thought, ‘they will be comfortably
well off, no matter what happens.’ So he
deeded Quasi to them.</p>

<p>“When the Federals succeeded, early in the war,
in seizing upon the sea island defences, establishing
themselves at Beaufort, Hilton Head, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
places, it was necessary for my grandfather to remove
all the negroes from Quasi, lest they be carried
off by the enemy. The place was therefore
abandoned, but my grandfather said that, at any
rate, nobody could carry off the land, and that that
would make my aunts easy in their finances, whenever
peace should come again. As he was a hard-fighting
officer, noted for his dare-devil recklessness
of danger, he did not think it likely that he would
live to see the end. But he believed he had made
his daughters secure against poverty, and as for my
father, he thought him man enough to take care of
himself.”</p>

<p>“The which he abundantly proved himself to be
when the time came,” interrupted Cal, with a note
of pride in his tone.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was a matter of course,” answered
Larry. “It’s a way the Rutledges have always
had. But that is no part of the story I’m telling.
During the last year of the war, when everything
was going against the South, grandfather saw
clearly what the result must be, and he understood
the effect it would have upon his fortunes. He was
a well-to-do man&mdash;I may even say a wealthy one&mdash;but
he foresaw that with the negroes set free and
the industries of the South paralyzed for the time,
his estate would be hopelessly insolvent. But like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the brave man that he was, he did not let these
things trouble him. Believing that his daughters
were amply provided for, and that my father&mdash;who
at the age of twenty-five had fought his way from
private to major&mdash;could look out for himself, the
grim old warrior went on with his soldierly work
and bothered not at all as to results.</p>

<p>“In the last months of the war, when the Southern
armies were being broken to pieces, the clerk’s
office, in which his deeds of Quasi to my aunts
were recorded, was burned with all its contents.
As evidence of the gift to his daughters nothing remained
except his original deeds, and these might
easily be destroyed in the clearly impending collapse
of everything. To put those deeds in some
place of safety was now his most earnest purpose.
He took two or three days’ leave of absence, hurried
to Charleston, secured the precious papers and
put them in a place of safety&mdash;so safe a place, indeed,
that to this day nobody has ever found them.
That was not his fault. For the moment he returned
to his post of command he sat down to write
a letter to my aunts, telling them what he had done
and how to find the documents. He had not written
more than twenty lines when the enemy fell
upon his command, and during the fight that ensued,
he was shot through the head and instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
killed. His unfinished letter was sent to my aunts,
but it threw no light upon the hiding place he had
selected.</p>

<p>“When the war ended, a few weeks later, the estate
was insolvent, as my grandfather had foreseen.
In the eagerness to get hold of even a little money
to live upon, which was general at that time, my
grandfather’s creditors were ready to sell their
claims upon the estate for any price they could get,
and two of the carrion crows called money-lenders
bought up all the outstanding obligations.</p>

<p>“When they brought suit for the possession of my
grandfather’s property, they included Quasi in their
claim. When my father protested that Quasi belonged
to his sisters by deeds of gift executed years
before, he could offer no satisfactory proof of his
contention&mdash;nothing, indeed, except the testimony
of certain persons who could swear that the transfer
had been a matter of general understanding,
often mentioned in their presence, and other evidence
of a similarly vague character.</p>

<p>“Of course this was not enough, but my father
is a born fighter and would not give up. He secured
delay and set about searching everywhere
for the missing papers. In the meanwhile he was
energetically working to rebuild his own fortunes,
and he succeeded. As soon as he had money of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
own to fight with, he employed the shrewdest and
ablest lawyers he could find to keep up the contest
in behalf of his sisters. He has kept that fight up
until now, and will keep it up until he wins it or
dies. Of course he has himself amply provided
for my aunts, so that it isn’t the property but a
principle he is fighting for.</p>

<p>“By the way, the shooting ought to be good at
Quasi&mdash;the place has run wild for so long and is
so inaccessible to casual sportsmen. If the rest of
you agree, we’ll make our way down there with
no long stops as we go. Then we can take our
time coming back.”</p>

<p>The others agreed, and after a little Dick Wentworth,
who had remained silent for a time, turned
to Larry, saying:</p>

<p>“Why did you say it wasn’t much of a story,
Larry?”</p>

<h2 class="p4">III</h2>

<p class="pch">A PROGRAMME&mdash;SUBJECT TO CIRCUMSTANCES</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Hunkydory</i> was an unusually large boat for
a craft of that kind. She was about twenty-five
feet long, very wide amidships&mdash;as dories always
are&mdash;and capable of carrying a heavy load without
much increase in her draught of water. She
was built of white cedar with a stout oak frame,
fastened with copper bolts and rivets, and fitted
with capacious, water-tight lockers at bow and
stern, with narrower lockers running along her
sides at the bilge, for use in carrying tools and the
like.</p>

<p>She carried a broad mainsail and a large jib, and
had rowlocks for four pairs of oars. Sitting on
the forward or after rowing thwart, where she was
narrow enough for sculls, one person could row her
at a fair rate of speed, so little resistance did her
peculiar shape offer to the water. With two pairs
of oars, or better still, with all the rowlocks in use,
she seemed to offer no resistance at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the plan of the boys to depend upon the
sails whenever there was wind enough to make any
progress at all, and ply the oars only when a calm
compelled them to do so.</p>

<p>“We’re in no sort of hurry,” explained Larry,
“and it really makes no difference whether we run
one mile an hour or ten. There aren’t any trains
to catch down where we are going.”</p>

<p>“Just where are we going, Larry,” asked Dick.
“We’ve never talked that over, except in the
vaguest way.”</p>

<p>“Show the boys, Cal,” said Larry, turning to
his brother. “You’re better at coast geography
than I am.”</p>

<p>“Hydrography would be the more accurate word
in this case,” slowly answered Cal, “but it makes
no difference.”</p>

<p>With that he lighted three or four more gas
burners, and spread a large map of the coast upon
the table.</p>

<p>“Now let me invoke your earnest attention,
young gentlemen,” he began. “That’s the way the
lecturers always introduce their talks, isn’t it?
You see before you a somewhat detailed map of
the coast and its waterways from Charleston, south
to Brunswick, Georgia. It is grossly inaccurate
in some particulars and slightly but annoyingly so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in others! Fortunately your lecturer is possessed
of a large and entirely trustworthy fund of information,
the garnerings, as it were, of prolonged
and repeated personal observation. He will be able
to correct the errors of the cartographer as he
proceeds.</p>

<p>“We will take the Rutledge boathouse on the
Ashley River near the foot of Spring Street as our
point of departure, if you please. <i>Enteuthen exelauni</i>&mdash;pardon
the lapse into Xenophontic Greek&mdash;I
mean thence we shall sail across the Ashley
to the mouth of Wappoo Creek which, as you see
by the map, extends from Charleston Harbor to
Stono Inlet or river, separating James Island from
the main. Thence we shall proceed up Stono
River, past John’s Island, and having thus disposed
of James and John&mdash;familiar characters in that
well-remembered work of fiction, the First Reader&mdash;we
shall enter the so called North Edisto
River, which is, in fact, an inlet or estuary, and
sail up until we reach the point where the real
Edisto River empties itself. Thence we shall proceed
down the inlet known as South Edisto River
round Edisto Island, and, by a little detour into
the outside sea, pass into St. Helena Sound. From
that point on we shall have a tangled network of
big and little waterways to choose among, and we’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
run up and down as many of them as tempt us
with the promise of sport or adventure. We shall
pass our nights ashore, and most of our days also,
for that matter. Wherever we camp we will remain
as long as we like. That is the programme.
Like the prices in a grocer’s catalogue and the
schedules of a railway, it is ‘subject to change
without notice.’ That is to say, accident and unforeseen
circumstances may interfere with it at
any time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we may ourselves change it,” said
Larry. “Indeed, I propose one change in it to start
with.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the others in chorus.</p>

<p>“Simply that we sail down the harbor first to
give Dick and Tom a glimpse of the points of interest
there. We’ll load the boat first and then,
when we’ve made the circuit of the bay, we needn’t
come back to the boat house, but can go on down
Wappoo cut.”</p>

<p>The plan commended itself and was adopted, and
as soon as the <i>Hunkydory’s</i> seams were sufficiently
soaked the boat was put in readiness. There was
not much cargo to be carried, as the boys intended
to depend mainly upon their guns and fishing tackle
for food supplies. A side of bacon, a water-tight
firkin of rice, a box of salt, another of coffee, a tin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
coffee-pot, and a few other cooking utensils were
about all. The tools and lanterns were snuggled
into the places prepared for them, an abundance of
rope was bestowed, and the guns, ammunition and
fishing tackle completed the outfit. Each member
of the little company carried a large, well-stocked,
damp-proof box of matches in his pocket, and each
had a large clasp knife. There were no forks or
plates, but the boat herself was well supplied with
agate iron drinking cups.</p>

<p>It was well after dark when the loading was finished
and the boat in readiness to begin her voyage.
It was planned to set sail at sunrise, and so the crew
went early to the joggling boards for a night’s rest
in the breezy veranda.</p>

<p>“We’ll start if there’s a wind,” said Cal.</p>

<p>“We’ll start anyhow, wind or no wind,” answered
Larry.</p>

<p>“Of course we will,” said Cal. “But you used
the term ‘set sail.’ I object to it as an attempt to
describe or characterize the process of making a
start with the oars.”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Cal, will you?” interjected Dick. “I
was just falling into a doze when you punched me
in the ribs with that criticism.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">IV</h2>

<p class="pch">TOM FIGHTS IT OUT</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fortunately</span> there was a breeze, rather light
but sufficient, when the sun rose next morning.
The <i>Hunkydory</i> was cast off and, with Cal at the
tiller, her sails filled, she heeled over and “slid on
her side,” as Tom described it, out of the Ashley
River and on down the harbor where the wind was
so much fresher that all the ship’s company had to
brace themselves up against the windward gunwale,
making live ballast of themselves.</p>

<p>The course was a frequently changing one, because
the Rutledge boys wanted their guests to pass
near all the points of interest, and also because they
wanted Dick Wentworth, who was the most expert
sailor in the company, to study the boat’s sailing
peculiarities. To that end Dick went to the helm
as soon as the wind freshened, and while following
in a general way the sight-seeing course suggested
by the Rutledges, he made many brief departures
from it in order to test this or that peculiarity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the boat, for, as Larry explained to Tom, “Every
sailing craft has ways of her own, and you want to
know what they are.”</p>

<p>After an hour of experiment, Dick said:</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get some sand bags somewhere.
We need more ballast, especially around the mast.
As she is, she shakes her head too much and is inclined
to slew off to leeward.”</p>

<p>“Let me take the tiller, then, and we’ll get what
we need,” answered Larry, going to the helm.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At Fort Sumter. I know the officer in command
there&mdash;in fact, he’s an intimate friend of our
family,&mdash;and he’ll provide us with what we need.
How much do you think?”</p>

<p>“About three hundred pounds&mdash;in fifty pound
bags for distribution. Two hundred might do, but
three hundred won’t be too much, I think, and if
it is we can empty out the surplus.”</p>

<p>“How on earth can you tell a thing like that by
mere guess work, Dick?” queried Tom in astonishment.</p>

<p>“It isn’t mere guess work,” said Dick. “In fact,
it isn’t guess work at all.”</p>

<p>“What is it, then?”</p>

<p>“Experience and observation. You see, I’ve
sailed many dories, Tom, and I’ve studied the behavior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of boats under mighty good sea schoolmasters&mdash;the
Gloucester fishermen&mdash;and so with a
little feeling of a boat in a wind I can judge pretty
accurately what she needs in the way of ballast,
just as anybody who has sailed a boat much, can
judge how much wind to take and how much to
spill.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to learn something about sailing if I
could,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“You can and you shall,” broke in Cal. “Dick
will teach you on this trip, and Larry and I will
act as his subordinate instructors, so that before we
get back from our wanderings you shall know how
to handle a boat as well as we do; that is to say, if
you don’t manage to send us all to Davy Jones during
your apprenticeship. There’s a chance of that,
but we’ll take the risk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s no better time to begin than
right now,” said Dick. “That’s a ticklish landing
Larry is about to make at Fort Sumter. Watch it
closely and see just how he does it. Making a
landing is the most difficult and dangerous thing one
has to do in sailing.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cal; “it’s like leaving off when
you find you’re talking too much. It’s hard to do.”</p>

<p>The little company tarried at the fort only long
enough for the soldiers to make and fill six canvas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
sand bags. When they were afloat again and Dick
had tested the bestowal of the ballast, he suggested
that Tom should take his first lesson at the tiller.
Sitting close beside him, the more expert youth
directed him minutely until, after perhaps an hour
of instruction, during which Dick so chose his
courses as to give the novice both windward work
and running to do, Tom could really make a fair
showing in handling the sails and the rudder. He
was still a trifle clumsy at the work and often
somewhat unready and uncertain in his movements,
but Dick pronounced him an apt scholar, and predicted
his quick success in learning the art.</p>

<p>They were nearing the mouth of the harbor when
Dick deemed it best to suspend the lesson and handle
the boat himself. The wind had freshened still
further, and a lumpy sea was coming in over the
bar, so that while there was no danger to a boat
properly handled, a little clumsiness might easily
work mischief.</p>

<p>The boys were delighted with the behavior of
the craft and were gleefully commenting on it when
Larry observed that Tom, instead of bracing himself
against the gunwale, was sitting limply on the
bottom, with a face as white as the newly made
sail.</p>

<p>“I say, boys, Tom’s seasick,” he called out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
“We’d better put about and run in under the lee of
Morris Island.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t,” answered Tom, feebly. “I’m not
going to be a spoil-sport, and I’ll fight this thing
out. If I could only throw up my boots, I’d be all
right. I’m sure it’s my boots that sit so heavily on
my stomach.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Tom,” said Larry, “but we’ll
run into stiller waters anyhow. We don’t want
you to suffer. If you were rid of this, I’d&mdash;”</p>

<p>He hesitated, and didn’t finish his sentence.</p>

<p>“What is it you’d do if I weren’t playing the
baby this way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” protested Tom, feeling his seasickness
less because of his determination to contest
the point. “What is it you’d do? You shall do
it anyhow. If you don’t, I’ll jump overboard. I
tell you I’m no spoil-sport and I’m no whining baby
to be coddled either. Tell me what you had in
mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was only a sudden thought, and probably
a foolish one. I was seized with an insane desire
to give the <i>Hunkydory</i> a fair chance to show what
stuff she’s made of by running outside down the
coast to the mouth of Stono Inlet, instead of going
back and making our way through Wappoo creek.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do it! Do it!” cried Tom, dragging himself
up to his former posture. “If you don’t do it I’ll
quit the expedition and go home to be put into pinafores
again.”</p>

<p>“You’re a brick, Tom, and you shan’t be humiliated.
We’ll make the outside trip. It won’t
take very long, and maybe you’ll get over the worst
of your sickness when we get outside.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t I’ll just grin and bear it,” answered
Tom resolutely.</p>

<p>As the boat cleared the harbor and headed south,
the sea grew much calmer, though the breeze continued
as before. It was the choking of the channel
that had made the water so “lumpy” at the
harbor’s mouth. Tom was the first to observe the
relief, and before the dory slipped into the calm
waters of Stono Inlet he had only a trifling nausea
to remind him of his suffering.</p>

<p>“This is the fulfillment of prophecy number one,”
he said to Cal, while they were yet outside.</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>“Why this way of getting into Stono Inlet.
You said our programme was likely to be ‘changed
without notice,’ and this is the first change. You
know it’s nearly always so. People very rarely
carry out their plans exactly.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” interrupted Larry as the Stono<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
entrance was made, “but I’ve a plan in mind that
we’ll carry out just as I’ve made it, and that not
very long hence, either.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Larry?”</p>

<p>“Why to pick out a fit place for landing, go
ashore, build a fire, and have supper. Does it occur
to you that we had breakfast at daylight and
that we’ve not had a bite to eat since, though it is
nearly sunset?”</p>

<p>As he spoke, a bend of the shore line cut off what
little breeze there was, the sail flapped and the dory
moved only with the tide.</p>

<p>“Lower away the sail,” he called to Cal and
Dick, at the same time hauling the boom inboard.
“We must use the oars in making a landing, and I
see the place. We’ll camp for the night on the
bluff just ahead.”</p>

<p>“Bluff?” asked Tom, scanning the shore. “I
don’t see any bluff.”</p>

<p>“Why there&mdash;straight ahead, and not five hundred
yards away.”</p>

<p>“Do you call that a bluff? Why, it isn’t three
feet higher than the low-lying land all around
it.”</p>

<p>“After you’ve been a month on this coast,” said
Cal, pulling at an oar, “you’ll learn that after all,
terms are purely relative as expressions of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
thought. We call that a bluff because it fronts
the water and is three feet higher than the general
lay of the land. There aren’t many places
down here that can boast so great a superiority to
their surroundings. An elevation of ten feet we’d
call high. It is all comparative.”</p>

<p>“Well, my appetite isn’t comparative, at any
rate,” said Tom. “It’s both positive and superlative.”</p>

<p>“The usual sequel to an attack of seasickness,
and I assure you&mdash;”</p>

<p>Cal never finished his assurance, whatever it was,
for at that moment the boat made her landing, and
Larry, who acted as commander of the expedition,
quickly had everybody at work. The boat was to
be secured so that the rise and fall of the tide would
do her no harm; wood was to be gathered, a fire
built and coffee made.</p>

<p>“And I am going out to see if I can’t get a
few squirrels for supper, while you fellows get
some oysters and catch a few crabs if you can.
Oh, no, that’s too slow work. Take the cast net,
Cal, and get a gallon or so of shrimps, in case
I don’t find any squirrels.”</p>

<p>“I can save you some trouble and disappointment
on that score,” said Cal, “by telling you now
that you’ll get no squirrels and no game of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
other kind, unless perhaps you sprain your ankle
or something and get a game leg.”</p>

<p>“But why not? How do you know?”</p>

<p>“We’re too close to Charleston. The pot-hunters
haven’t left so much as a ground squirrel in
these woods. I have been all over them and so I
know. Better take the cartridges out of your gun
and try for some fish. The tide’s right and you’ve
an hour to do it in.”</p>

<p>Larry accepted the suggestion, and rowing the
dory to a promising spot, secured a dozen whiting
within half the time at disposal.</p>

<p>Supper was eaten with that keen enjoyment
which only a camping meal ever gives, and with a
crackling fire to stir enthusiasm, the boys sat for
hours telling stories and listening to Dick’s account
of his fishing trips along the northern shores, and
his one summer’s camping in the Maine woods.</p>

<p class="pch">A RATHER BAD NIGHT</p>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the next two or three days the expedition
worked its way through the tangled maze of
big and little waterways, stopping only at night,
in order that they might the sooner reach a point
where game was plentiful.</p>

<p>At last Cal, who knew more about the matter
than any one else in the party, pointed out a vast
forest-covered region that lay ahead, with a broad
stretch of water between.</p>

<p>“We’ll camp there for a day or two,” he said,
“and get something besides sea food to eat. There
are deer there and wild turkeys, and game birds,
while squirrels and the like literally abound. I’ve
hunted there for a week at a time. It’s only about
six miles from here, and there’s a good breeze.
We can easily make the run before night.”</p>

<p>Tom, who had by that time learned to handle the
boat fairly well for a novice, was at the tiller, and
the others, a trifle too confident of his skill perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
were paying scant attention to what he was
doing. The stretch of water they had to cross was
generally deep, as the chart showed, but there were
a few shoals and mud banks to be avoided. While
the boys were eagerly listening to Cal’s description
of the hunting grounds ahead, the boat was
speeding rapidly, with the sail trimmed nearly flat,
when there came a sudden flaw in the wind and
Tom, in his nervous anxiety to meet the difficulty
managed to put the helm the wrong way. A second
later the dory was pushing her way through
mud and submerged marsh grass. Tom’s error
had driven her, head on, upon one of the grass covered
mud banks.</p>

<p>Dick was instantly at work. Without waiting
to haul the boom inboard, he let go the throat and
peak halyards, and the sails ran down while the
outer end of the boom buried itself in the mud.</p>

<p>“Now haul in the boom,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you wait and do that first?” asked
Tom, who was half out of his wits with chagrin
over his blunder.</p>

<p>“Because, with the centre board up, if we’d
hauled it in against the wind the boat would have
rolled over and we should all have been floundering.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the centre board was down,” answered
Tom.</p>

<p>“Look at it,” said Cal. “Doubtless it was
down when we struck, but as we slid up into the
grass it was shut up like a jackknife.”</p>

<p>“Stop talking,” commanded Larry, “and get to
the oars. It’s now or never. If we don’t get
clear of this within five minutes we’ll have to lie
here all night. The tide is just past full flood and
the depth will grow less every minute. Now then!
All together and back her out of this!”</p>

<p>With all their might the four boys backed with
the oars, but the boat refused to move. Dick
shifted the ballast a little and they made another
effort, with no result except that Tom, in his well-nigh
insane eagerness to repair the damage done,
managed to break an oar.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, fellows,” said Larry. “You might
as well ship your oars. We’re stuck for all night
and must make the best of the situation.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we get out and push her off?” asked
Tom in desperation.</p>

<p>“No. We’ve no bottom to stand on. The mud
is too soft.”</p>

<p>“That’s one disadvantage in a dory,” said Dick,
settling himself on a thwart. “If we had a keel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
under us, we could have worked her free with the
oars.”</p>

<p>“If, yes, and perhaps,” broke in Cal, who was
disposed to be cheerfully philosophical under all circumstances.
“What’s the use in iffing, yessing and
perhapsing? We’re unfortunate in being stuck on
a mud bank for the night, but stuck we are and
there’s an end of that. We can’t make the matter
better by wishing, or regretting, or bemoaning
our fate, or making ourselves miserable in any
other of the many ways that evil ingenuity has devised
for the needless chastisement of the spirit.
Let us ‘look forward not back, up and not down,
out and not in,’ as Dr. Hale puts it. Instead of
thinking how much happier we might be if we were
spinning along over the water, let us think how
much happier we <i>shall</i> be when we get out of this
and set sail again. By the way, what have we on
board that we can eat before the shades of night
begin falling fast?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you will ‘look forward,’ as you’ve
advised us all to do,” said Dick Wentworth, “by
which I mean if you will explore the forward
locker, you’ll find there a ten-pound can of sea biscuit,
and half a dozen gnarled and twisted bologna
sausages of the imported variety, warranted to keep
in any climate and entirely capable of putting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
strain upon the digestion of an ostrich accustomed
to dine on tenpenny nails and the fragments of
broken beer bottles.”</p>

<p>“Where on earth did they come from?” asked
Larry. “I superintended the lading of the
boat&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you did, and I watched you. I
observed that you had made no provision for shipwreck
and so I surreptitiously purchased and bestowed
these provisions myself. The old tars at
Gloucester deeply impressed it upon my mind that
it is never safe to venture upon salt water without
a reserve supply of imperishable provisions to
fall back upon in case of accidents like this.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t an accident,” said Tom, who had
been silent for an unusual time; “it isn’t an accident;
it’s the result of my stupidity and nothing
else, and I can never&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now stop that, Tom!” commanded Cal; “stop
it quick, or you’ll meet with the accident of being
chucked overboard. This was a mishap that might
occur to anyone, and if there was any fault in the
case every one of us is as much to blame as you are.
You don’t profess to be an expert sailor, and we
know it. We ought some of us to have helped you
by observing things. Now quit blaming yourself,
quit worrying and get to work chewing bologna.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, Cal,” was all that Tom could say
in reply, and all set to work on what Dick called
their “frugal meal,” adding:</p>

<p>“That phrase used to fool me. I found it in
Sunday School books, where some Scotch cotter
and his interesting family sat down to eat scones
or porridge, and I thought it suggestive of something
particularly good to eat. Having the chronically
unsatisfied appetite of a growing boy, the thing
made me hungry.”</p>

<p>“This bologna isn’t a bit bad after you’ve
chewed enough of the dry out of it to get the
taste,” said Larry, cutting off several slices of the
smoke-hardened sausage.</p>

<p>“No,” said Dick, “it isn’t bad; but I judge
from results that the Dutchman who made it had
rather an exalted opinion of garlic as a flavoring.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Cal answered, speaking slowly after his
habit, “the thing is thoroughly impregnated with
the flavor and odor of the <i>allium sativum</i>, and I
was just revolving&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Cal?” asked Larry, interrupting.</p>

<p>“What’s what?”</p>

<p>“Why, <i>allium</i> something or other&mdash;the thing
you mentioned.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean <i>allium sativum</i>? Why, that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the botanical name of the cultivated garlic plant,
you ignoramus.”</p>

<p>“Well, how did you come to know that? You
never studied botany.”</p>

<p>“No, of course not. I’ll put myself to the trouble
of explaining a matter which would be obvious
enough to you if you gave it proper thought. I
found the term in the dictionary a month or so
ago when you and I had some discussion as to the
relationship between the garlic and the onion. I
may have been positive in such assertions as I found
it necessary to make in maintaining my side of the
argument; doubtless I was so; but I was not sufficiently
confident of the soundness of my views to
make an open appeal to the dictionary. I consulted
it secretly, surreptitiously, meaning to fling it at your
head if I found that it sustained my contentions.
As I found that it was strongly prejudiced on your
side, I refrained from dragging it into the discussion.
But I learned from it that garlic is <i>allium
sativum</i>, and I made up my mind to floor you with
that morsel of erudition at the first opportunity.
This is it.”</p>

<p>“This is what?”</p>

<p>“Why, the first opportunity, to be sure. I’m
glad it came now instead of at some other time.”</p>

<p>“Why, Cal?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why because we have about eleven hours of
tedious waiting time before us and must get rid
of it in the best way we can. I’ve managed to wear
away several minutes of it by talking cheerful nonsense
and spreading it out over as many words as
I could. I’ve noticed that chatter helps mightily
to pass away a tedious waiting time, and I’m profoundly
convinced that the very worst thing one
can do in a case like ours is to stretch the time out
by grumbling and fretting. If ever I’m sentenced
to be hanged, I shall pass my last night pouring
forth drivelling idiocy, just by way of getting
through what I suppose must be rather a trying
time to a condemned man.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Cal, you were just beginning to say
something else when Larry interrupted you to ask
about the Latin name of garlic. You said you
were ‘just revolving.’ As you paused without any
downward inflection, and as you certainly were
not turning around, I suppose you meant you
were just revolving something or other in your
mind.”</p>

<p>“Your sagacity was not at fault, Tom, but my
memory is. I was revolving something in my
mind, some nonsense I suppose, but what it was,
I am wholly unable to remember. Never mind;
I’ll think of a hundred other equally foolish things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to say between now and midnight, and by that time
we’ll all be asleep, I suppose.”</p>

<p>It was entirely dark now, and Dick Wentworth
lighted a lantern and hoisted it as an anchor light.</p>

<p>“What’s the use, Dick, away out here?” asked
one of the others.</p>

<p>“There may be no use in it,” replied Dick, “but
a good seaman never asks himself that question.
He just does what the rules of navigation require,
and carries a clear conscience. If a ship has to stop
in mid ocean to repair her machinery even on the
calmest and brightest of days when the whole horizon
is clear, the captain orders the three discs set
that mean ‘ship not under control.’ So we’ll let
our anchor light do its duty whether there is need
of it or not.”</p>

<p>“That’s right in principle,” said Larry, “and
after all it makes no difference as that lantern
hasn’t more than a spoonful of oil in it. But most
accidents, as they are called&mdash;”</p>

<p>Larry was not permitted to say what happened
to “most accidents,” for as he spoke Tom called
out:</p>

<p>“Hello! it’s raining!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;sprinkling,” answered Larry, holding
out his hand to feel the drops, “but it’ll be pouring
in five minutes. We must hurry into our oilskins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
There! the anchor light has burned out and
we must fumble in the dark.”</p>

<p>With that he opened a receptacle and hurriedly
dragged the yellow, oil-stiffened garments out, saying
as he did so:</p>

<p>“It’s too dark to see which is whose, but we’re
all about of a size and they don’t cut slickers to
a very nice fit. So help yourselves and put ’em on
as quickly as you can, for it’s beginning to pour
down.”</p>

<p>The boys felt about in the dark until presently
Cal called out:</p>

<p>“I say, fellows, I want to do some trading. I’ve
got hold of three pairs of trousers and two squams,
but no coat. Who wants to swap a coat for two
pairs of trousers and a sou’wester?”</p>

<p>The exchanges were soon made and the waterproof
garments donned, but not before everybody
had got pretty wet, for the rain was coming down
in torrents now, such as are never seen except in
tropical or subtropical regions.</p>

<p>The hurried performance served to divert the
boys’ minds and cheer their spirits for a while, but
when the “slickers” were on and closely fastened
up, there was nothing to do but sit down again in
the dismal night and wait for the time to wear
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now this is just what we needed,” said Cal,
as soon as the others began to grow silent and
moody.</p>

<p>“What, the rain?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It helps to occupy the mind. It gives
us something to think about. It is a thing of interest.
By adding to our wretchedness, it teaches
us the lesson that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t want any lessons, Cal; school’s
out,” said Dick. “What I want to know is
whether you ever saw so heavy a rain before.
I never did. Why, there are no longer any drops&mdash;nothing
but steady streams. Did you ever see
anything like it?”</p>

<p>“Often, and worse,” Larry answered. “This is
only an ordinary summer rain for this coast.”</p>

<p>“Well now, I understand&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Permit me to interrupt,” broke in Cal, “long
enough to suggest that the water in this boat is
now half way between my ankles and my knees,
and I doubt the propriety of suffering it to rise
any higher. Suppose you pass the pump, Dick.”</p>

<p>Dick handed the pump to his companion, who
was not long in clearing the boat of the water.
Then Tom took it and fitfully renewed the pumping
from time to time, by way of keeping her clear.
After, perhaps, an hour, the rain slackened to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
drizzle far more depressing to the spirits than the
heavy downpour had been. The worst of the
matter was that the night was an intensely warm
one, and the oilskin clothing in which the boys
were closely encased, was oppressive almost beyond
endurance. Presently Dick began unbuttoning his.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Dick? “Tom asked as he
heard the rustle.</p>

<p>“Opening the cerements that encase my person,”
Dick answered.</p>

<p>“But what for?”</p>

<p>“Why, to keep from getting too wet. In these
things the sweat that flows through my skin is distinctly
more dampening than the drizzling rain.”</p>

<p>“I’d smile at that,” said Cal, “if it were worth
while, as it isn’t. We’re in the situation Charles
Lamb pityingly imagined all mankind to have been
during the ages before candles were invented. If
we crack a joke after nightfall we must feel of our
neighbor’s cheek to see if he is smiling.”</p>

<p>The desire for sleep was strong upon all the company,
and one by one they settled themselves in
the least uncomfortable positions possible under the
circumstances, and became silent in the hope of
catching at least a cat nap now and then. There
was very little to be done in that way, for the moment
one part of the body was adjusted so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
nothing hurt it, a thwart or a rib, or the edge of
the rail, or something else would begin “digging
holes,” as Larry said, in some other part.</p>

<p>Cal was the first to give up the attempt to sleep.
After suffering as much torture as he thought he
was called upon to endure he undoubled himself
and sat upright. The rest soon followed his example,
and Cal thought it best to set conversation
going again.</p>

<p>“After all,” he said meditatively, “this is precisely
what we came to seek.”</p>

<p>“What? The wretchedness of this night? I
confess I am unable to take that view of it,” answered
Larry almost irritatedly.</p>

<p>“That is simply because your sunny temper is
enshrouded in the murky gloom of the night, and
your customary ardor dampened by the drizzle.
You are not philosophical. You shouldn’t suffer
external things to disturb your spiritual calm. It
does you much harm and no manner of good. Besides,
it is obvious that you judged and condemned
my thought without analyzing it.”</p>

<p>“How is that, Cal? Tell us about it,” said
Dick. “Your prosing may put us to sleep in spite
of the angularity and intrusive impertinence of
everything we try to rest ourselves upon. Do your
own analyzing and let us have the benefit of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s simple enough. I indulged in the reflection
that this sort of thing is precisely what we
set out on this expedition to find, and it is so, if
you’ll only think of it. We came in search of two
things&mdash;adventure and game. Surely this mud-bank
experience is an adventure, and I’m doing my
best to persuade you fellows to be ‘game’ in its
endurance.”</p>

<p>“That finishes us,” said Dick. “A pun is discouraging
at all times; a poor, weak-kneed, anæmic
pun like that is simply disheartening, and coming
at a time of despondency like this, it reduces every
fibre of character to a pulp. I feel that under its
influence my back bone has been converted into
guava jelly.”</p>

<p>“Your speech betrayeth you, Dick. I never
heard you sling English more vigorously than now.
And you have regained your cheerfulness too, and
your capacity to take interest. Upon my word,
I’ll think up another pun and hurl it at you if it is
to have any such effect as that.”</p>

<p>“While you’re doing it,” said Larry, “I’m going
to get myself out of the sweatbox I’ve been in all
night. You may or may not have observed it,
but the rain has ceased, and the tide has turned
and if I may be permitted to quote Shakespeare,
‘The glow-worm shows the matin to be near.’ In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
modern phrase, day is breaking, and within about
two hours the <i>Hunkydory</i> will be afloat again.”</p>

<p>With the relief of doffing the oppressive oilskins,
and the rapidly coming daylight, the spirits of the
little company revived, and it was almost a jolly
mood in which they made their second meal on
hard ship biscuit and still harder smoked bolognas.</p>

<h2 class="p4">VI</h2>

<p class="pch">A LITTLE SPORT BY THE WAY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day had just asserted itself when Larry,
looking out upon the broad waters of a sound that
lay between the dory and the point at which the
dory would have been if she had not gone aground,
rather gleefully said:</p>

<p>“We’ll be out of our trouble sooner than we
hoped. The <i>Hunkydory</i> will float well before the
full flood.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think so, Larry?” asked Tom,
who had not yet recovered from his depression
and was still blaming himself for the mishap and
doubting the possibility of an escape that morning.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it; I know,” answered Larry, beginning
to shift ballast in a way that would make
backing off the mud bank easier.</p>

<p>“But how do you know?”</p>

<p>“Because there’s a high wind outside and it’s
blowing on shore. Look at the white caps out
there where the water is open to the sea. We’re in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a sort of pocket here, and feel nothing more than a
stiff breeze, but it’s blowing great guns outside, and
when that happens on an incoming tide the water
rises a good deal higher than usual. We’ll float
before the tide is at the full.”</p>

<p>“In my judgment we’re afloat now,” said Dick,
who had been scrutinizing the water just around
them. “We’re resting on the marsh grass, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“So we are,” said Cal, after scanning things a
bit. “Let’s get to the oars!”</p>

<p>“Better wait for five or ten minutes,” objected
Dick. “We might foul the rudder in backing off.
Then we’d be in worse trouble than we were before.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Dick,” answered Cal, restraining his
impatience and falling at once into his peculiarly
deliberate utterance. “That is certainly so, and I
have been pleased to observe, Dick, that many
things you say are so.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for the compliment, Cal, and for
what it implies to the contrary.”</p>

<p>“Pray don’t mention it. Take a look over the
bow instead and see how she lies now.”</p>

<p>In spite of their banter, that last ten minutes of
waiting seemed tediously long, especially to Tom,
who wanted to feel the boat gliding through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
water again before forgiving himself for having
run her aground. At last the bow caught the force
of the incoming flood, and without help from anybody
the dory lifted herself out of the grass and
drifted clear of the mud bank.</p>

<p>The centre board was quickly lowered, the sails
hoisted, the burgee run up to the masthead, and, as
the <i>Hunkydory</i> heeled over and began plowing
through the water with a swish, her crew set up a
shout of glee that told of young hearts glad again.</p>

<p>A kindly, gentle thought occurred to Dick Wentworth
at that moment. It was that by way of reassuring
Tom and showing him that their confidence
in him was in no way shaken, they should
call him to the helm at once. Dick signalled his
suggestion to Larry, by nodding and pointing to
Tom, whose eyes were turned away. Larry was
quick to understand.</p>

<p>“I say, Tom,” he called out, “come to the tiller
and finish your job. It’s still your turn to navigate
the craft.”</p>

<p>Tom hesitated for a second, but only for a second.
Perhaps he understood the kindly, generous
meaning of the summons. However that might
be, he promptly responded, and taking the helm
from Larry’s hand, said, “Thank you, Larry&mdash;and
all of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>That was all he said; indeed, it was all that he
could say just then.</p>

<p>Suspecting something of the sort and dreading
every manifestation of emotion, as boys so often do,
Larry quickly diverted all minds by calling out:</p>

<p>“See there! Look! There’s a school of skipjacks
breaking water dead ahead. Let’s have some
fun trolling for them. We haven’t any appointed
hours and we’re in no hurry, and trolling for skipjacks
is prime sport.”</p>

<p>“What are they, anyhow?” asked Dick, who
had become a good deal interested in the strange
varieties of fish he had seen for the first time on
the southern coast.</p>

<p>“Why, fish, of course. Did you think they were
humming birds?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I should have been
greatly astonished if I had found them to be something
of that kind. Since you introduced me to
flying fish the other day, I’m prepared for anything.
But what I wanted to know was what sort of fish
the skipjacks are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was it? Well, they’re what you call
bluefish up north, I believe. They are variously
named along the coast&mdash;bluefish, jack mackerel,
horse mackerel, skipfish, skipjacks, and by some
other names, I believe, and they’re about as good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
fish to eat as any that swims in salt water, by whatever
name you call them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve eaten them as bluefish,” answered
Dick. “They’re considered a great dainty in Boston
and up north generally.”</p>

<p>“They’re all that,” answered Larry, “and catching
them is great sport besides, as you’ll agree after
you’ve had an hour or so of it. We must have
some bait first. Tom, run her in toward the mouth
of the slough you see on her starboard bow about
a mile away. See it? There, where the palmetto
trees stand. That’s it. She’s heading straight at
the point I mean. Run her in there and bring her
head into the wind. Then we’ll find a good place
and beach her, and I’ll go ashore with the cast net
and get a supply of shrimps.”</p>

<p>“Is it a wallflower or a widow you’re talking
about, Larry?” languidly asked Cal, while his
brother was getting the cast net out and arranging
it for use.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Cal? Some pestilent nonsense,
I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” drawled Cal. “I was chivalrously
concerned for the unattached and unattended female
of whom you’ve been speaking. You’ve mentioned
her six times, and always without an escort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” answered Larry, who was always
quick to catch Cal’s rather obscure jests. “Well,
by the pronouns ‘she’ and ‘her,’ I meant the good
ship <i>Hunkydory</i>. She is now nearing the shore
and if you don’t busy yourself arranging trolling
lines and have them ready by the time I get back
on board of her with a supply of shrimps, I’ll see
to it that you’re in no fit condition to get off another
feeble-minded joke like that for hours to come.
There, Tom, give her just a capful of wind and run
her gently up that little scrap of sandy beach. No,
no, don’t haul your sheet so far&mdash;ease it off a bit,
or she’ll run too far up the shore. There! That’s
better. The moment her nose touches let the sheet
run free. Good! Dick himself couldn’t have done
that better.”</p>

<p>With that he sprang ashore, and with the heavily
leaded cast net over his arm and a galvanized iron
bait pail in his hand, hurried along the bank to the
mouth of the slough, where he knew there would
be multitudes of shrimps gathered for purposes of
feeding. After three or four casts of the net he
spread it, folded, over the top of his bait bucket to
keep the shrimps he had caught from jumping out.
Within fifteen minutes after leaping ashore he was
back on board again with a bucket full of the bait
he wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, then,” he said to Dick and Tom, “Cal
will show you how to do the thing. I’ll sail the
boat back and forth through the schools, spilling
wind so as to keep speed down. Oh, it’s great
sport.”</p>

<p>“Well, you shall have your share of it then,”
said Dick, carefully coiling his line. “After I’ve
tried it a little, and seen what sort of sailing it
needs, I’ll relieve you at the tiller and you shall take
my line.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the kind,” said Cal with a
slower drawl than usual by way of giving emphasis
to his words. “Not if I see you first. After
Larry has run us through the school two or three
times, missing it more than half the time, I’ll take
the tiller myself and give you a real chance to hook
a fish or two.”</p>

<p>Dick knew Cal well enough to understand that
he was in earnest and that there would be no use
in protesting or arguing the matter. Besides that,
he hooked a big fish just at that moment, and was
jerked nearly off his feet. The strength of the
pull astonished him for a moment. He had never
encountered a fish of any kind that could tug like
that, and for the moment he forgot that the dory
was doing most of the pulling. In the meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
he had lost his fish by holding his line too firmly
and dragging the hook out of its mouth.</p>

<p>“That’s your first lesson,” said Cal, as deliberately
as if there had been no exciting sport on hand,
and with like deliberation letting his own line slip
slowly through his tightened fingers. “You must
do it as I am doing it now,” he continued. “You
see, I have a fish at the other end of my line and I
want to bring him aboard. So instead of holding
as hard as a check post, I yield a little to the exigencies
of the situation, letting the line slip with
difficulty through my fingers at first and long
enough to transmit the momentum of the boat to
the fish. Then, having got his finny excellency
well started in the way he should go, I encourage
persistency in well doing on his part by drawing in
line. Never mind your own line now. We’ve run
through the school and Larry is heaving-to to let
Tom and me land our fish. You observe that Tom
has so far profited by his close study of my performance
that&mdash;yes, he has landed the first fish,
and here comes mine into the boat. You can set
her going again, Larry; I won’t drag a line this
time, but devote all my abilities to the instruction
of Dick.”</p>

<p>On the next dash and the next no fish were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
hooked. Then, as the boat sailed through the
school again, Dick landed two beauties, and Tom
one.</p>

<p>“That ends it for to-day,” said Larry, laying
the boat’s course toward the heavily wooded mainland
at the point where Cal had suggested a stay of
several days for shooting.</p>

<p>“But why not make one more try?” eagerly
asked Tom, whose enthusiasm in the sport was
thoroughly aroused; “haven’t we time enough?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Larry, “but we have fish enough
also. The catch will last us as long as we can
keep the fish fresh, which isn’t very long in this
climate, and we never catch more fish or kill more
game than we can dispose of. It is unsportsmanlike
to do that, and it is wanton cruelty besides.”</p>

<p>“That’s sound, and sensible, and sportsmanlike,”
said Dick, approvingly. “And besides, we really
haven’t any time to spare if we’re going to stop on
the island yonder for dinner, as we agreed,
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And as at least one appetite aboard the <i>Hunkydory</i>
insists that we shall,” interrupted Cal. “It’s
after three o’clock now.”</p>

<p>“So say we all of us,” sang Tom to the familiar
after-dinner tune, and Larry shifted the course so
as to head for an island nearly a mile away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>There a hasty dinner was cooked and eaten, but
hasty as it was, it occupied more time in preparation
than had been reckoned upon, so that it was
fully five o’clock when the dory was again cast off.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the wind had sunk to a mere
zephyr, scarcely sufficient to give the heavy boat
steerage way, and, late in the day, as it was, the
sun shone with a sweltering fervor that caused the
boys to look forward with dread to the prospect of
having to resort to the oars.</p>

<p>That time came quickly, and the sails, now useless
in the hot, still air, were reluctantly lowered.</p>

<p>A stretch of water, more than half a dozen miles
in width, lay before them, and the tide was strong
against them. But they pluckily plied the oars
and the heavy boat slowly but surely overcame the
distance.</p>

<p>They had found no fresh water on the island,
and there was very little in the water kegs when
they left it for their far-away destination. The
hard work of rowing against the tide in a hot atmosphere,
made them all thirsty, so that long before
they reached their chosen landing place, the
last drop of the water was gone, with at least two
more hours of rowing in prospect.</p>

<p>“There’s a spring where I propose to land,” said
Cal, by way of reassuring his companions. “As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
I remember it, the water’s a bit brackish, but it is
drinkable at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you can find the spot in the dark,
Cal?” asked Larry, with some anxiety in his voice.
“For it’ll be pitch dark before we get there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I can find it,” his brother answered.</p>

<p>“There’s a deep indentation in the coast there&mdash;an
inlet, in fact, which runs several miles up
through the woods. We’ll run in toward the shore
presently and skirt along till we come to the mouth
of the creek. I’ll find it easily enough.”</p>

<p>But in spite of his assurances, the boys, now severely
suffering with thirst, had doubts, and to
make sure, they approached the shore and insisted
that Cal should place himself on the bow, where
he could see the land as the boat skirted it.</p>

<p>This left three of them to handle four oars. One
of them used a pair, in the stern rowlocks, where
the width of the boat was not too great for sculls,
while the other two plied each an oar amidships.</p>

<p>In their impatience, and tortured by thirst as
they were, the three oarsmen put their backs into
the rowing and maintained a stroke that sent the
boat along at a greater speed than she had ever before
made with the oars alone. Still it seemed to
them that their progress was insufferably slow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently Cal called to them: “Port&mdash;more to
port&mdash;steady! there! we’re in the creek and have
only to round one bend of it. Starboard! Steady!
Way enough.”</p>

<p>A moment later the dory slid easily up a little
sloping beach and rested there.</p>

<p>“Where’s your spring, Cal?” the whole company
cried in chorus, leaping ashore.</p>

<p>“This way&mdash;here it is.”</p>

<p>The spring was a small pool, badly choked, but
the boys threw themselves down and drank of it
greedily. It was not until their thirst was considerably
quenched that they began to observe how
brackish the water was. When the matter was
mentioned at last, Cal dismissed it with one of his
profound discourses.</p>

<p>“I’ve drunk better water than that, I’ll admit;
but I never drank any water that I enjoyed more.”
Then he added:</p>

<p>“You fellows are ungrateful, illogical, unfair,
altogether unreasonable. That water is so good
that you never found out its badness till after it had
done you a better service than any other water in
the world ever did. Yet now you ungratefully revile
its lately discovered badness, while omitting to
remember its previously enjoyed and surpassing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
goodness. I am so ashamed of you that I’m going
to start a fire and get supper going. I for one
want some coffee, and it is going to be made of
water from that spring, too. Those who object to
brackish coffee will simply have to go without.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">VII</h2>

<p class="pch">AN ENEMY IN CAMP</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> sooner was the camp fire started than Cal
went to the boat and brought away a piece of tarpaulin,
used to protect things against rain. With
this and a lighted lantern he started off through
the thicket toward the mouth of the little estuary,
leaving Dick to make coffee and fry fish, while
Larry mixed a paste of corn meal, water and a little
salt, which he meant presently to spread into
thin sheets and bake in the hot embers, as soon as
the fire should burn down sufficiently to make a
bed of coals.</p>

<p>As Cal was setting out, Tom, who had no particular
duty to do at the moment, asked:</p>

<p>“Where are you off to, Cal?”</p>

<p>“Come along with me and see,” Cal responded
without answering the direct question. “I may
need your help. Suppose you bring the big bait
bucket with you. Empty the shrimps somewhere.
They’re all too dead to eat, but we may need ’em
for bait.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom accepted the invitation and the two were
quickly beyond the bend in the creek and well out
of sight of the camp. As they neared the open
water, Cal stopped, held the lantern high above his
head, and looked about him as if in search of something.
Presently he lowered the lantern, cried out,
“Ah, there it is,” and strode on rapidly through
the dense undergrowth.</p>

<p>Tom had no time to ask questions. He had
enough to do to follow his long-legged companion.</p>

<p>After a brief struggle with vines and undergrowths
of every kind, the pair came out upon a
little sandy beach with a large oyster bank behind
it, and Tom had no further need to ask questions,
for Cal spread the tarpaulin out flat upon the sands,
and both boys began gathering oysters, not from
the solid bank where thousands of them had their
shells tightly welded together, but from the water’s
edge, and even from the water itself wherever it
did not exceed a foot or so in depth. Cal explained
that these submerged oysters, being nearly all the
time under salt water, and growing singly, or nearly
so, were far fatter and better than those in the
bank or near its foot.</p>

<p>It did not take long to gather quite as many of
the fat bivalves as the two could conveniently carry
in the tarpaulin and the bait pail, and as Cal was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
tying up the corners of the cloth Tom began
scrutinizing the sandy beach at a point which the
ordinary tides did not reach. As he did so he observed
a queer depression in the sand and asked Cal
to come and see what it meant.</p>

<p>After a single glance at it, Cal exclaimed gleefully:</p>

<p>“Good for you, Tom. This is the luckiest find
yet.”</p>

<p>With that he placed the lantern in a favorable
position, emptied the bait pail, hurriedly knelt down,
and with his hands began digging away the sand.</p>

<p>“But what is it, Cal? What are you digging
for?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you in half a minute,” said the other,
continuing to dig diligently. Less than the half
minute later he began drawing out of the sand a
multitude of snow-white eggs about the size of a
walnut. As Tom looked on in open-mouthed wonder,
he thought there must be no end to the supply.</p>

<p>“What are they, Cal?” the boy asked.</p>

<p>“Turtle’s eggs, and there’s a bait bucket full of
them. You’ve made the luckiest find of all, Tom,”
he said again in congratulation.</p>

<p>“Are they good to eat?”</p>

<p>“Good to eat? Is anything you ever tasted good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to eat? Why, Tom, they’re about the rarest delicacy
known to civilized man. In Charleston they
sell at fabulous prices, when there happen to be
any there to sell. Now we must hurry back to the
fire, for the ash cakes must be about done and the
coffee made.”</p>

<p>After a moment or two of silence, Tom asked:</p>

<p>“Why did you think there was an oyster bank
down there, Cal?”</p>

<p>“I noticed it as we came into the creek and I
took pains to remember its location. But here we
are. See, fellows, what Tom has found! Now
bring on your coffee and your ash cakes and your
fish, and we’ll feast like a company of Homer’s
warriors. It won’t take long to boil the eggs in
salt water&mdash;ten minutes is the allotted time, I believe,
in the case of turtle’s eggs, and during that
time we can be eating the other things and filling
up with fire-opened oysters.”</p>

<p>With that he threw three or four oysters upon
the coals, removing them as soon as they opened
and swallowing them from the shell. The others
followed his example.</p>

<p>Of course it really was an excellent supper the
boys were eating out there under the stars, but
sharp-set hunger made it seem even better than it
was, and the contrast between it and the supper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of bologna sausages and hardtack of the night before,
added greatly to the zest of their feasting.
They rejoiced, too, in being free, out there in the
woodlands, with no dismal rain to depress their
spirits and no restraint of any kind upon their liberty.</p>

<p>But they were all very tired after their sleepless
night before and their hard-working day, and without
argument or discussion, one by one of them
stretched himself before the fire not long after supper,
and fell asleep. Cal remained awake longer
than the rest, though he, too, was lying flat upon
his back, ready to welcome sleep as soon as it should
come to his eyelids.</p>

<p>Before it came he was moved by jealousy or mischief
to disturb the others with an admonition.</p>

<p>“You fellows are recklessly trifling with your
health, every one of you, and it is my duty to warn
you of the consequences. In allowing so brief a
time to elapse between the consumption of food
in generous quantities, and your retirement to your
couches, you are inviting indigestion, courting bad
dreams and recklessly risking the permanent organic
and functional impairment of your constitutions&mdash;to
say nothing of your by-laws, orders of business,
rules of procedure and other things that should be
equally precious to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Will</i> you shut up, Cal?” muttered Dick, half
awake. Tom remained unconscious and Larry responded
only with a snore.</p>

<p>Presently even Cal’s wakefulness yielded, his
thoughts wandered, and he fell into a sound slumber.</p>

<p>The woodlands were as still as woodlands at
night ever are; the stars shone brilliantly in a perfectly
clear sky; the brush wood fire died down to
a mass of glowing coals and gray ashes, and still
the weary ship’s company slept on without waking
or even moving.</p>

<p>Then something happened, and Larry, who was
always alert, even in his sleep, suddenly sat up, at
the same time silently grasping the gun that lay
by his side. He was sure he had heard a noise in
his sleep, but now that he was wide awake, everything
seemed profoundly still. Nevertheless he
waited and watched. Then suddenly he brought
his gun to his shoulder, and in sharp, ringing tones
cried out:</p>

<p>“Drop that!”</p>

<p>Instantly all the boys were standing with their
guns in hand, not knowing what had happened, but
ready to meet whatever might come. A second or
two later Larry, still sitting and aiming his gun
over his bent knees, called out again:</p>

<p>“Drop that, I say! Drop it instantly or I’ll
shoot. I’ve got a bead on you. Now throw up
your hands! Quick, and no fooling.”</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>As he gave this command he rose and slowly
advanced toward the dory, keeping his gun levelled
from his shoulder.</p>

<p>It was difficult to see anything, until Tom
thought to throw a bunch of dry brush upon the
coals. As it blazed up the boys saw the man whom
Larry had held up. He was standing by the boat,
his back toward them and his hands, held up in
obedience to Larry’s command.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, see what shooting irons he has
about him,” directed Larry, who stood with the
muzzle of his shotgun less than three feet away
from the prisoner.</p>

<p>Dick, Cal and Tom searched the man’s clothes,
but found no weapons of any sort there. Tom was
thoughtful enough to search his long-legged leather
boots, and from each of them he presently drew a
murderous-looking army revolver. Without saying
a word, the boy sprung the pistols open and
emptied them of their cartridges, which he tossed
into the creek.</p>

<p>“Now you may let your hands down,” said
Larry, at the same time lowering his piece, but continuing
to hold it with both barrels at full cock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cal, take care of that box of cartridges I made
him drop, and take a lantern and look the boat
over. He may have done some damage before trying
to steal our ammunition.”</p>

<p>Up to this time the intruder, a huge man of evil
countenance, had spoken no word. Now he suddenly
took the initiative.</p>

<p>“Who are you fellers, anyhow, and what are you
a-doing here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Curiously enough,” responded Cal, “those are
precisely the questions I was going to ask you.
Suppose you answer first. Who are you and what
are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“That’s for me to know and you to find out,”
the intruder replied, truculently.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’d better reconsider that,” said Cal.
“You’re a prisoner, you know, caught in the act
of stealing our ammunition, and we are armed.
We can chuck you into our boat and take you to a
magistrate, who will provide you with jail accommodations
for a while. Give an account of
yourself. What did you come to our camp
for?”</p>

<p>“I come,” he replied with somewhat less assurance
in his tone, “to find out who you fellers was,
and what you’re a-doin’ here where you don’t belong,
and to give you fair warnin’ to git away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
here jest as quick as you know how. Ef you don’t,
it’ll be a good deal the worse for you.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do nothing of the kind,” broke in Larry.
“We’re on land that belongs to Mr. Hayward, a
friend of ours, and we’re going to stay here as long
as we like.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do it at your own resk, then. You’ve
got me hard and fast, but they’s others besides me.”</p>

<p>“Now listen to me,” said Larry, rising and
speaking sharply. “We’ve got you hard and fast,
as you say, and we could take you to jail or we
could hold you as a hostage, if you know what that
means; but we’ll do neither. We’re not afraid of
you or the ‘others’ you mentioned. We are going
to turn you loose and dare you to do your worst.
We’ve a right to be where we are, and we’re going
to stay here till we’re ready to go. We’re armed,
and we know how to shoot. But there’ll be no
holding up of hands the next time any of you invade
our camp, and there’ll be no challenging. It’ll
be quick triggers. Now go! We expect to stay
here for three or four days. Go!”</p>

<p>The man moved off through the woods, with a
peculiar limp in his left leg, turning about when at
a little distance, and shouting:</p>

<p>“It’ll be the worse for you! I’ve give you fair
warnin’.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">CAL BEGINS TO DO THINGS</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Wonder</span> what it all means,” said Tom, when
the man had limped away through the undergrowth
and out of hearing.</p>

<p>“It means, for one thing,” said Cal, “that we’re
practically in a state of siege here. We must all
be on the alert and never all sleep at once.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Larry, “and that isn’t enough. We
must guard ourselves against surprise by day as
well as by night. As soon as it grows light enough
in the morning I’ll explore our surroundings and
see what may best be done. It is now a trifle after
four o’clock, and we shan’t go to sleep again. Why
not have breakfast and make a long day of it. I
want to get some game, for one thing. I wonder
if that fellow’s gang, whoever they are, have cleaned
all the wild things out of these woods.”</p>

<p>“You can rest easy as to that,” said Cal.
“We’ll have something fit to eat for dinner to-day,
and I’ll have it here in time to cook it properly for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that meal. What I am wondering about is who
those fellows are, and what they are doing around
here, and why they don’t want us around.”</p>

<p>“Then you believe what that fellow said?” asked
Dick. “You believe in the existence of those others’
with whose vengeance he threatened us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t. There may be another man
down here with that one, fishing or hunting, but I
don’t believe in the presence of a company of
them.”</p>

<p>“But why not, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Simply because it is unlikely. On its face it
seems to me more likely that, as we had caught that
fellow stealing, he invented the formidable and
vengeful force theory just to scare us into letting
him go. What would there be for such a band as
he suggests to do down here in these lonely woods?
What is there here to attract such a band?”</p>

<p>“I am not prepared to answer those questions,”
said Cal. “I can’t imagine what a gang of that
sort could be doing here, or why they are here, or
anything about it. But it is my firm conviction
that we have need to keep cartridges in our guns and
about our persons.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s of course,” answered Dick; “though
if there is any such gang and they don’t attack us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
early this morning, we needn’t look for them before
night, so we’ll have plenty of time for getting
a good supply of game.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Cal. “And by way of making
sure, as it’s coming on daylight now, I’ll go and
get that turkey gobbler I was speaking of. I’ll be
back to breakfast.”</p>

<p>With that Cal started off, gun in hand, leaving
the rest to wonder.</p>

<p>“How can he be so confident of finding game?”
Dick asked, with a note of incredulity in his voice.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Larry, “but it’s nine
chances in ten that he’ll do it. He’s the wiliest
hunter I ever knew, and with all his chatter, he
never says a thing of that kind without meaning
it; especially he never gives a positive promise
unless he is confident of his ability to fulfill
it. So I expect to see him back here before we
have breakfast ready, with a turkey gobbler slung
over his shoulders.”</p>

<p>“Why ‘gobbler,’ Larry?” Dick asked, looking
up from the mortar in which he was pounding the
coffee.</p>

<p>“How do you mean, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Why, it wasn’t just a turkey that Cal promised
us, but specifically a gobbler, and now when you
speak of it you also assume that the bird he is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
kill will be of the male sex. Why may it not be a
turkey hen?”</p>

<p>“Why, he wouldn’t think of shooting a turkey
hen at this time of year. They’re bringing up
their chicks now and they won’t be fit to eat for a
month yet. So if he brings any turkey with him
it’ll be a bearded old gobbler as fat as butter.”</p>

<p>At that moment a shot was heard at some distance.
The next instant there was another, after
which all was still.</p>

<p>“I say, Larry, I don’t like that,” said Tom uneasily.</p>

<p>“Don’t like what?”</p>

<p>“Why, those two shots in quick succession.
Maybe Cal has met some of that gang and they’ve
shot him. Hadn’t we better go to his assistance?”</p>

<p>“You may go if you are uneasy, Tom,” answered
Larry; “but it isn’t at all necessary I think.
Cal knows how to take care of himself.”</p>

<p>“But how do you account for the two shots in
such quick succession?”</p>

<p>“By the fact that Cal usually hunts with cartridges
in both barrels of his gun just as other people
do. He may have missed at the first fire. In
that case he would take a second shot if he could
get it.”</p>

<p>Tom was somewhat reassured by this suggestion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
but he was not entirely free from anxiety
until ten minutes later when he heard the crackling
of dry branches under Cal’s big boots. A moment
afterwards Cal himself appeared, with two
huge gobblers slung over his neck.</p>

<p>“So you got one with each barrel,” quietly commented
Larry, feeling of the birds to test their fatness.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. That’s what I fired twice for.
Did you imagine I’d shoot the second barrel just
for fun? By the way, isn’t breakfast nearly ready?
I’m pretty sharp set in this crisp morning air.”</p>

<p>“I must say, Cal,” said Dick, as the little company
sat on the ground to eat their breakfast,
“you’re the very coolest hand I ever saw. Why,
if I had shot two big gobblers out of one flock of
turkeys I’d be tiring the rest of you with minute
descriptions&mdash;more or less inaccurate, perhaps&mdash;of
just how I did it, and just how I felt while doing
it, and just how the turkeys behaved, and all the
rest of it.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” asked Cal between sips of
coffee. “The facts are simple enough. We
wanted some turkeys and I went out to get them.
I knew where they were roosting and I got there
before time for them to quit the roost. I shot one
from the limb on which he had passed the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
The others flew, of course, and I shot one of them
on the wing. That’s absolutely all there is to tell.
I like to get my game when I go for it but I never
could see the use of holding a coroner’s inquest
over it.”</p>

<p>“What puzzles me,” said Tom, “is how on
earth you knew just where those turkeys were
roosting. Did you just guess it?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not. If I had, I shouldn’t have
been so ready to promise you a gobbler as I was.”</p>

<p>“Then how did you know?”</p>

<p>“I saw the roost last night.”</p>

<p>“When, and how?”</p>

<p>“When you and I were out after the oysters.
Do you remember that just before we came out of
the woods and upon the beach, I stopped and held
up the lantern and looked all around?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you were looking for the oyster bed
and you found it.”</p>

<p>“I was looking for the oyster bed, of course.
But I was looking for anything else there might be
to see, too. I always do that. When I was at the
bow last night looking for the mouth of this creek
I saw the oyster bed, and marked its locality in
my mind. In the same way, when I was looking
for the oyster bed with the lantern above my head,
I saw the turkey-roost and carefully made mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
note of its surroundings so that I might go straight
to it this morning. Is there any other gentleman
in the company who would like to ask me questions
with a view to the satisfaction of his curiosity
or the improvement of his mind?”</p>

<p>“I for one would like to ask you what else you
saw this morning while you were out after the turkeys,”
answered Tom. “Apparently you never
look for one thing without finding some others of
equal or superior importance. Did you do anything
of that sort this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. I made two observations, in
fact, and both of them seem to me to possess a certain
measure of interest.”</p>

<p>Cal paused in his speech at this point and proceeded
to eat his breakfast quite as if the others had
not been waiting for him to go on with whatever
it was that he had to tell.</p>

<p>“You’re the most provoking fellow I ever saw,
Cal,” said Tom, impatiently. “When you have
nothing to say that is in the least worth saying,
you grind out words like a water mill, till you bury
yourself and the rest of us in the chaffy nonsense.
But when you have something to tell that we’re all
eager to hear, you shut up like a clam at low tide.
Go on, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I have always heard,” replied Cal, in leisurely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
fashion, as if his only purpose had been to prevent
the conversation from flagging, “that one of the
most necessary arts of the orator is that of getting
his audience into a condition of anxious waiting
for his words before he really says the thing they
want to hear. I cannot myself claim the title of
orator, but I’m practicing and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>Will</i> you stop that nonsense, Cal, and tell us
what you have in mind? If not we’ll duck you in
the creek.”</p>

<p>It was Larry who uttered this threat.</p>

<p>“I’ve had worse things than that happen to me,”
answered Cal, imperturbably. “The morning is
sunny and the sea water on this coast closely approximates
tepidity. By the way, Dick, our higher
water temperature seems to mar the edibility of
some fish that are deemed good at the North.
There’s what you call the weak fish&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, for the reason that Dick
had approached him from behind, seized his shoulders
and toppled him over upon the ground.</p>

<p>“Now tell us what we’re waiting to hear!” Dick
commanded, still holding his comrade down upon
his back.</p>

<p>“My mouth’s full of sand,” Cal managed to say;
“let me up and I’ll make a clean breast of it, on
honor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick loosed his hold, and as soon as Cal had
rinsed his mouth, he redeemed his promise.</p>

<p>“Well, the first thing I discovered was that
there’s a promising young deer at present haunting
this neck of the woods, and we’re all going out to
involve it in controversy with us to-day, and then
shoot it as its just due for defying us in such impudent
fashion.”</p>

<p>“Venison!” exclaimed Tom enthusiastically;
“how my mouth waters for a taste of its juiciness!
But how do you know about it, Cal?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t venison yet,” slowly answered the
other. “You are much too hasty in jumping at
conclusions. That deer will not be venison until
we find it and convert it into meat of that justly
esteemed sort. Now to answer your question; I
discovered its tracks and followed them far enough
to know whither it was wending its way and about
where to look for it when you fellows quit your
ceaseless talking and are ready for the chase.
There’s no great hurry, however, as the tracks were
made this morning and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” interrupted Tom.</p>

<p>“I smelt them.”</p>

<p>“But how? I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“It oughtn’t to be difficult for even you, Tom, to
make out that if I smelt the tracks, I employed my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
nose for that purpose. I usually smell things in
just that way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, you know what I mean. I didn’t
imagine any creature but a well-trained hound
could discover a scent in a deer’s track.”</p>

<p>“Obviously your imagination is in need of a reinforcement
of facts then. I’ll furnish them. In
the middle of a deer’s foot there is a little spot that
bears an odor sweeter than that of attar of roses
and quite as pronounced. For that reason many
young ladies, and some who are not so young perhaps,
like to keep a deer’s foot among their daintiest
lingerie. Now, when a deer puts his foot down
it spreads sufficiently to bring that perfumed spot
in contact with the earth and the track is delicately
perfumed. When the odor is pronounced it indicates
that the track is newly made.</p>

<p>“Now that I have fully answered your intruded,
if not intrusive question, Tom, perhaps I may be
permitted to finish the sentence you interrupted.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, go on. Really, Cal, I didn’t
mean&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t. I was saying that there is
no need of haste in going after that deer, because
the tracks were made this morning, and the marshy
thicket toward which the deer was making his way
is sufficiently rich in succulent grasses and juicy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
young cane to occupy his mind for the entire day,
and several days. A little later we’ll cut off his
retreat on the land side of the point, and if we
don’t get him the fault will be with our inexpertness
with our guns.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Cal,” broke in Larry, “and
I’m glad you’ve marked down the deer; but just
now I must be off to plan our defense. You’ve
taken so long to tell us about your first discovery
that I can’t wait to hear about the second.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you can,” replied Cal. “It will save
you a lot of trouble, and I can tell it in about half
a dozen words.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead and tell it, then.”</p>

<p>“It is simply that I have solved the whole problem
of defense.”</p>

<p>“How? Tell us about it!”</p>

<p>“Why, just above our camp&mdash;up the creek a
few hundred yards, there’s a big gum tree, with
an easily accessible crotch, comfortable to sit in,
from which the one playing sentinel can see everything
we want to see. He can look clear across
this point and half a mile or more up the creek, and
by turning his head he can see the camp itself and
the <i>Hunkydory</i> and even the soiled spots on your
coats. All we’ve got to do is to keep a sentinel
in that gum tree, and nobody can approach our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
camp unseen, whether he comes by land or by water.
Come on and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>The whole company followed Cal, and after a
minute inspection found the lookout to be quite as
satisfactory as he had represented it to be. But
Tom, who had made up his mind to acquire Cal’s
habit of observation, noticed some things about the
place that aroused his curiosity. He said nothing
about them at the time, but resolved to read the
riddle of their meaning if he could. To that end
he asked to be the first to serve as sentinel.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Larry. “You can stay here
till we’re ready to go after that deer. Then I’ll
take your place.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, so that you may have your share in the
deer hunt.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t either of you bother about that,”
said Cal. “Our camp can be seen all the way to
the cane brake where the deer is browsing, and also
from one of the points at which a man must stand
with his gun when we drive the deer. So we shan’t
need any other sentinel and we’ll all go. With all
of us together over there we’ll be ready to repel any
attack on ourselves, and if anybody invades the
camp we’ll swoop down upon him and exterminate
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a good deal to be done at the camp
before going after the deer. The turkeys were to
be picked and dressed and one of them to be
roasted. Some fishing was to be done and it was
necessary to put up some sort of bush shelter for
use in case of rain. So, leaving Tom as sentinel,
the other boys went back to the anchorage, and
Tom began his scrutiny of the things he had observed.</p>

<p>As a last injunction Larry said: “You can
come in to dinner, Tom, when I whistle through
my fingers. If there’s nobody in sight then, we
can risk the dinner hour without a sentry.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">IX</h2>

<p class="pch">A FANCY SHOT</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> things that had attracted Tom’s attention
were so trifling in themselves that only a person
alertly observing would have noticed them at all.
Yet Tom thought they might have significance, and
he was bent upon finding out what that significance
was.</p>

<p>First of all, he had observed that a little blind
trail seemed to lead westward from the tree, and
in no other direction, as if it had been made by
someone who visited the tree and then returned
by the way he had come, going no farther in any
direction. The trail was so blind that Tom could
not be sure it was a trail at all. If so, it had been
traversed very infrequently, and at rather long intervals.
If it had been the only suggestive thing
seen, the boy would probably not have given it a
thought. But he observed also that the bark of the
gum tree was a trifle scarred at two points, suggesting
that some one with heavy boots on had recently
climbed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the other boys had gone back to camp,
Tom set to work to make a closer inspection of
his surroundings. He climbed the tree to the
crotch and looked about him. There was nothing
there, but from that height he could trace the little
trail through the bushes for perhaps fifty or a
hundred yards. He satisfied himself in that way
that it was really a trail, made by the passage of
some living thing, man or beast, through the dense
undergrowth.</p>

<p>“I’ll follow that trail after a while,” he resolved,
“but I’ll say nothing about it now. I might be
laughed at for my pains. Not that I mind that,
of course. We fellows are well used to being
laughed at among ourselves. But when I say anything
about this, I want to have something to tell
that is worth telling. After all, it may be only
the path of a deer or of one of the queer little wild
horses&mdash;tackeys, they call them&mdash;that live in the
swamps. Or a wild hog may have made it. I
don’t know, and I’m not going to talk about the
thing till I can talk to some purpose.”</p>

<p>As he wriggled around in the crotch, he dropped
his knife from his pocket.</p>

<p>“That’s a reminder,” he reflected, “that people
sometimes drop things when they don’t intend to.
If anybody else has been roosting up here he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
have dropped things, too. I’ll recover my knife and
then I’ll search around the tree.”</p>

<p>He was on the ground now, and having replaced
his knife he began a minute search of the space
for ten or twenty feet around the tree. It was
thickly carpeted with the densely-growing vegetation
that is always quick to take possession of
every unoccupied inch of ground in the far southern
swamps and woodlands. Searching such a
space for small objects was almost a hopeless task,
and finding nothing, Tom was on the point of giving
up the attempt, when he trod upon something.
Examining it, he found it to be an old corncob
pipe with a short cane stem. It was blackened by
long smoking, and that side of it which had lain
next to the ground had begun to decay. But there
was half-burned tobacco in it still.</p>

<p>From all these facts Tom thought it likely that
the pipe, while still alight, had been dropped from
the tree, and that its owner had failed to find it upon
his descent.</p>

<p>“That means that somebody was using this tree
for a lookout a good while ago. I can’t imagine
why or wherefore, but I mean to find out if I can.
Just now I hear Larry’s whistle calling me to dinner.
I wonder how he manages to make that shrill
shrieking noise by putting two fingers into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
mouth and blowing between them. I must get him
to teach me the trick.”</p>

<p>It was decided at dinner that the deer hunt should
occur as soon as that meal was finished.</p>

<p>“The deer will be lying down, chewing the cud,
at this time of day,” explained Larry to his two
guests, who had never shared a deer hunt, “and so
we shan’t disturb him in placing ourselves. What’s
the nature of the ground, Cal? Can three of us
cover it while the fourth drives?”</p>

<p>“We must,” Cal answered. “It may give some
one of us a very long shot, but with nitro-powder
cartridges these modern guns of ours will pitch
buckshot a long way. The marsh in which the
deer is feeding is on a sort of peninsula which is
surrounded by water except on one side. That
land side is a rather narrow neck, narrow enough
for three guns to cover it, I think, if the guns are
well handled. Fortunately the marsh itself is
small. If it weren’t we might drive all day, as
we have no dogs, without routing the deer out. As
it is, I think I can start him, and I’ll do the driving
after I post you three at the three best points of
observation.”</p>

<p>“How do you ‘drive,’ as you call it, Cal?” Dick
asked.</p>

<p>“Well, if we had dogs and horses, as we always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
do in a regular deer hunt, the man appointed to
drive would ride around to the farther side of the
swamp, and put the dogs into it. The dogs would
scatter out into an irregular line and zigzag to one
side and the other in search of the quarry. In that
way they would advance till they found the deer
and set him running toward the line of men on the
posts. Every one of these would be intently looking
and listening till the deer should come running
at top speed in an effort to dash past his enemies
and escape. The man on the post nearest where
he breaks through is expected to bring him down
with a quick shot aimed at his side, just behind the
shoulder.”</p>

<p>“But what if he misses?”</p>

<p>“In that case the deer has won the game. As
we have no dogs and there are only four of us, I
mean to post you three at the points I find best
suited, and then I’ll play hounds myself. I’ll go
round to the farther side of the little swamp, invade
it as noisily as I can, whooping and hallooing
in the hope of getting the deer up. If I do, he’ll
make a dash to get out of the swamp, and if no
one of you manages to shoot him in the act, we’ll
have none of that juicy venison that you, Tom,
thought you had almost in your mouth when I first
told you that the deer was here. Now let us be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
off. We’re burning daylight. Load with buckshot
cartridges.”</p>

<p>When the neck of the little peninsula was
reached, Cal bade his comrades wait at the point
from which their camp could be seen, while he
should go over the ground and pick out the places
to be occupied as posts.</p>

<p>On his return he placed the others each at the
point he had chosen for him, taking care that Tom
and Dick should have the places near which the
quarry was most likely to make his effort to break
through.</p>

<p>“Now, you must keep perfectly still,” he admonished
the two inexperienced ones, “and keep
both eyes and three ears, if you have so many,
wide open. You may see the deer without hearing
him, or you may hear him tearing through the
bushes before you see him. That will give you
notice of his coming, but don’t let him fool you.
He may not come straight on from the spot at
which you hear him. If he catches sight, sound or
smell of you, he’ll veer off in some other direction.
So if you hear him coming don’t move a muscle
except those of your eyes.</p>

<p>“Now I’m off to drive. If I can, I’ll get him up
and away. After that everything will depend upon
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>It was nearly half an hour before the boys heard
Cal’s shoutings in the distance, but slowly coming
nearer. After that, in the eager watching and
waiting, the seconds seemed minutes, and the minutes
dragged themselves out into what seemed
hours.</p>

<p>At last, however, Dick heard the deer breaking
through bushes just ahead of him. In another second
the frightened creature burst into view and
Dick fired, missing the game, which instantly
changed its course and ran away toward its left,
with the speed of the wind. Dick, in his excited
disappointment, fired his second barrel at a hopelessly
long range.</p>

<p>Almost immediately he heard a shot from Tom’s
gun, and after that all was still. Cal struggled
out of the swamp, while Larry and Dick made their
way toward Tom’s post, “to hear,” Cal said, “just
what excuses the novices have invented on the spur
of the moment by way of accounting for their bad
marksmanship.”</p>

<p>“I have none to offer,” said Dick, manfully.
“I missed my shot, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“How is it with you, Tom? What plea have
you to offer?”</p>

<p>“None whatever,” answered Tom. “Yonder
lies the deer by the side of the fallen tree. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
was taking a flying leap over it when I shot him&mdash;on
the wing, as it were.”</p>

<p>The congratulations that followed this complete
surprise may be imagined. Cal fairly “wreaked
himself upon expression” in sounding his praises
of Tom’s superb marksmanship, and better still, his
coolness and calmness under circumstances, as Cal
phrased it, “that might have disturbed the equipoise
of an Egyptian mummy’s nerve centres.”</p>

<p>Tom took all this congratulation and extravagance
of praise modestly and with as little show of
emotion as he had manifested while making his difficult
shot.</p>

<p>Perhaps this was even more to his credit than
the other. For this was the first time Tom Garnett
had ever seen a deer hunt, or a live deer, either,
for that matter.</p>

<h2 class="p4">X</h2>

<p class="pch">TOM’S DISCOVERIES</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> no attack had been made upon the camp the
boys gradually relaxed the vigilance of their guard
duty; but they still maintained a sentry at the lookout
tree at night and made occasional visits of observation
during the day, going to the tree sufficiently
often to avoid being taken by surprise.</p>

<p>“And what if they should attack us in daytime?”
argued Dick. “We’d be here, armed and
ready for them.”</p>

<p>There was fishing to be done, and a game of
chess or backgammon was usually in progress.
Moreover, like any other company of bright youths
accustomed to think, they had enough to talk about,
many things to explain to each other, many stories
to tell, and many questions to discuss. Thus the
daytime sentry duty was reduced to nearly no activity,
except upon Tom’s part. He was apparently
fond of going to the lookout and remaining there
sometimes for hours at a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The others did not know why he should care for
that as for an amusement. Tom did, but he said
nothing. Tom was finding out something that the
others knew nothing about.</p>

<p>On the next morning but one after the deer hunt
he had climbed to the crotch of the tree to make a
further study of the trail he had discovered. After
a little while he decided to climb farther up the
tree, in order to secure a better view.</p>

<p>From that loftier perch he saw something at a
distance that deeply interested him. It was a sort
of hovel, so buried in undergrowth that it would
have been scarcely visible at all except to one looking
from a high place as he was.</p>

<p>But what interested him most was that presently
he saw the lame intruder of two nights before
come out of the hovel and limp down toward the
shore, where, as Tom easily made out, there was a
small, crooked little cove running into the woods,
not from the creek, but from the broader water outside.</p>

<p>Tom lost sight of the man when he reached the
cove, and so did not make out what he was doing
there, but after a time he saw him limp away again
and go back to the neighborhood of the hovel,
which, however, he did not enter or approach very
nearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>He loitered around for awhile, like one who
must remain where he is, but who has nothing to
do there during an indefinitely long and tedious
waiting time. At last he stretched himself out on
a log in the shadow of the trees, as if to pass away
the time in sleep.</p>

<p>Tom’s curiosity was by this time master of him.
Having seen so much, he was eager to see more.
Accordingly he clambered down the tree, and, with
gun in hand, set out to follow the blind trail.</p>

<p>He moved silently from the first, and very cautiously
toward the end of his half-mile journey.
He was careful not to tread upon any of the dry
sticks that might make a noise in breaking, and to
permit no bush to swish as he let it go.</p>

<p>At last he reached the neighborhood of the hovel,
and, securing a good hiding place in the dense undergrowth,
minutely studied his surroundings.
The lame man lay still on his log and apparently
asleep, until after awhile the sun’s changing position
brought his face into the strong glare. Then
he rose lazily, rubbing his eyes as if the sleep were
not yet out of them. Rising at last, with muttered
maledictions upon the heat, he limped over to a
clump of palmetes and from among them lifted
a stone jug, from which he took a prolonged
draught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the stuff to brace a man up!” he muttered
as he replaced the jug in its hiding place.</p>

<p>Tom observed that there were nowhere any
traces of a camp fire, present or past, a fact that
puzzled him at first, for obviously the man lived
there in the thicket, or at least remained there for
prolonged periods at a time, and, as Tom reflected,
“he must eat.”</p>

<p>The man himself solved the riddle for him presently
by going to another of his hiding places and
bringing thence a great handful of coarse ship biscuit
and a huge piece of cold pickled beef of the
kind that sailors call “salt-horse,” which he proceeded
to devour.</p>

<p>“Obviously,” reflected Tom, “his food, such as
it is, is brought to him here already cooked. He
makes no fire, probably because he fears its light
by night or the smoke of it by day might reveal his
presence here. But why does he stay here? What
is he here for? Who are they who bring him
food, and when or how often do they come, and
for what purpose? It’s a Chinese puzzle, but I
mean to work it out.”</p>

<p>Having made his observation of the place as minute
as he could Tom silently crept away, not walking
in the trail, but through the bushes near enough
to let him see it and follow its winding course. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
did this lest by walking too often in the trail he
should leave signs of its recent use.</p>

<p>When he reached the lookout tree, to his surprise
he found his three comrades there.</p>

<p>“Hello! What are you fellows doing here?”
he asked, breaking out of the bushes and thus giving
the first sign his comrades had had of his approach,
for even to the end of his little journey he
had been at pains to travel in absolute silence as
an Indian on the war path does.</p>

<p>“Why, Tom, where have you been?” was the
first greeting the others gave him.</p>

<p>“We’ve been dreadfully uneasy about you,”
Larry explained, “and when I whistled through
my fingers to call you to dinner and you didn’t
come, we hurried out here to look for you. Where
<i>have</i> you been and what have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“I say, Larry, that reminds me that I want you
to teach me the trick of whistling through my fingers
in that way. Will you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll teach you some things that are easier to
learn than that,” answered his companion, “if you
try any more of Cal’s tricks of beating round the
bush. Why don’t you tell us where you’ve been
and why, and all the rest of it? Don’t you understand
that we’ve been on tenterhooks of anxiety
about you for an hour?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, as I’m here, safe and sound, there is no
further need of anxiety, and as for your curiosity
to hear what I have to tell, I’ll relieve that while
we’re at dinner. Come on! I’m hungry and I
reckon the rest of you are, too. Anyhow, what
I’ve got to tell you is well worth hearing, and I
shall not tell you a word till we sit down on our
haunches and begin to enjoy again the flavor of that
venison, broiled on the live coals. You haven’t
cooked it yet, have you?”</p>

<p>“No. We got the chops ready for the fire, and
then I whistled for you, so that we might all have
them fresh from the coals. As you didn’t come,
we got uneasy and went to look for you. So come
on and we’ll have a late dinner and sharp appetites.”</p>

<p>No sooner were the juicy venison chops taken
from the fire and served upon a piece of bark that
did duty as a platter than the demand for the story
of Tom’s morning adventure became clamorous.</p>

<p>With a chop in one hand and half an ash cake
in the other, Tom told all that he had done and
seen, giving the details as the reader already knows
them. Then, after finishing the meal and washing
his hands, face and head in the salt water of the
creek, he set forth the conclusions and conjectures
he had formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the first place,” he said, “I am certain that
our late visitor&mdash;he with the game leg&mdash;is the
only person anywhere around. We are in no danger
of an attack, either by night or by day, until his
comrades, whoever they may be, come here and
join him. We have no need of doing sentry duty
out there at the gum tree, except to keep a sufficient
lookout to make sure that we know when
they do come. In my opinion that will be at night
sometime.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think so, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Simply because it is evident that they don’t
come here for any good or lawful purpose. If that
lame fellow with the whisky jug is a fair sample of
the crew, they are the sort that prefer darkness to
light because their deeds are evil.”</p>

<p>“Who do you think they are, Tom?” asked
Cal, “and what, in your opinion, are they up
to?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I mean to find out.”</p>

<p>“How, Tom?”</p>

<p>“By watching, and, if I don’t find out sooner, by
being within sight when they do come. I’m going
to reconnoiter the place again to-night to see what
that fellow does down there. Perhaps I may make
out something from that. At any rate, it’s worth
trying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t we all go with you?” Dick
asked eagerly. “Then if by any accident that evil-visaged
person with the lame leg should discover
you, we’ll be there in force enough to handle him
and the situation. I’ve heard that one of your
southern generals during the Civil War once said
that strategy is ‘getting there first with the most
men.’ Why shouldn’t we practice strategy?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, I counted on that,” Tom answered.
“I knew all you fellows would want to
go, and I reckon that’s our best plan. Anyhow,
we’ll try it.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Cal, “I have something to report
which I regard as of some little importance, particularly
as it means that the <i>Hunkydory</i> will have
to leave this port pretty soon&mdash;probably within the
next forty-eight hours, and possibly sooner.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter, Cal?” asked all the
others together.</p>

<p>“Only that our spring is rapidly drying up, and
as there is no other fresh water supply within
reach, we shall simply be obliged to quit these parts
as soon as we can get ourselves in shape to risk it.”</p>

<p>“To risk what?”</p>

<p>“Why, putting off in a boat on salt water. We
can’t do that without some fresh water on board.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
I’ve already begun the filling of the kegs by thimblefuls.
It promises to be a slow process, as the spring
seems unable to yield more than a gill or so at a
time.”</p>

<p>“But, Cal,” interrupted Tom, “we can get all
the water we want by digging a little anywhere
around here. It doesn’t lie three feet below the
surface.”</p>

<p>“Neither does the fever,” answered Cal.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, I mean that the milky-looking water you
find by digging a few feet into the soil of these low-lying
lands is poisonous. It is surface water, an
exudation from the mass of decaying vegetable
matter that constitutes the soil of the swamps. To
drink it is to issue a pressing invitation to fever,
dysentery and other dangerous and deadly diseases,
to take up their permanent residence in our
intestinal tracts.”</p>

<p>“But why isn’t the water of our spring just as
bad?”</p>

<p>“Because it isn’t surface water at all, but spring
water that comes from a source very different from
that of the swamp soil. You have perhaps observed
that the bottom of our spring is composed of clean,
white sand, through which the water rises. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
sand was brought up by that water from strata that
lie far below the soil.”</p>

<p>“What makes it brackish, then?”</p>

<p>“It is brackish because a certain measure of sea
water from the creek there sipes into it. The sea
water is filtered through the sand, losing most of
its salt in the process. You’ve noticed, perhaps,
that the spring water is more brackish at high than
at low tide. That’s because&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see all that now. I hadn’t thought of it
before. But really, Cal, it seems rather hard that
we must sail away from here just when we’ve run
up against something mysterious and interesting.
Now, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Let me remind you,” answered Cal in his most
elaborate manner of mock-serious speaking, “that
I am in nowise called upon to assume responsibility
for the vagaries of a casually encountered
spring. I did not bring up that spring. I had no
part in its early education or training. Presumably
it is even my superior in age and experience.
In any case, I feel myself powerless to control or
even to influence its behavior. Moreover, I feel as
keen a disappointment as you can in the fact that
we shall have to abandon our search for knowledge
of the purposes of our neighbor with the game
leg. But it is not certain that we shall have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
sail away with that inquiry unfinished. It will
take a considerable time to fill our water kegs, and
in the meanwhile we may penetrate the mystery
sooner than we expect. Anyhow, we’ll see what
we shall see to-night.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">XI</h2>

<p class="pch">PERILOUS SPYING</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Dick’s suggestion the boys cut a number of
larger logs than usual and placed them on their
camp fire that evening before setting out on their
expedition.</p>

<p>“It will avert suspicion of what we are at,” Dick
said in explanation of his proposal. “So long as
the camp fire burns up brightly nobody seeing it
from a distance will doubt that we are here. It
isn’t much trouble, anyhow.”</p>

<p>The night proved to be an unusually dark one,
with an overcast sky, threatening rain, and on the
chance of that Cal rigged up the largest tarpaulin
the company owned and so arranged it as to conduct
all the water that might fall upon it into the
bait pail and such other receptacles as would hold
it. “If it rains hard,” he explained, “we’ll catch
enough water before morning to fill both the kegs.”</p>

<p>Going to the big gum tree, Tom climbed to the
top of it to see if he could discover anything the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
little company might want to know. After a careful
scrutiny of the landscape to the west he came
down again, reporting that everything was quiet “in
the region of our late visitor’s country seat.”</p>

<p>Then the party set out on their exploring expedition.
Tom, acting as guide, followed the little blind
trail, while the rest made their way through the
undergrowth on either side, keeping near enough
to the trail to hear even a whispered warning or
direction if Tom should have need to give any such.</p>

<p>Slowly, carefully, and in profound silence, they
made their way to the point from which Tom had
watched the place during the day. Then, as had
been arranged in advance, the four stretched out
their little line, so as to see the place from different
points of view.</p>

<p>At first there was not much to see, and on so
dark a night even that little could be seen only indistinctly
and with difficulty. The “man with the
game leg,” as the boys called him, was moving
about the place in a leisurely fashion, but what he
was doing none of the investigating party could
make out in the darkness, though they had crept
very close to the camp and were watching intently.</p>

<p>At last their watching and waiting were rewarded
by a happening which interested them, though they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
did not understand it. The man with the game leg
went into the hovel Tom had seen, and after remaining
there for a considerable time, came out
again. As he did so the boys were easily able to
make out that he carried a dark lantern in his hand.
It was carefully closed, but there were little leaks
of light from its fastenings, as there always are
from such contrivances when they are of the common,
cheap variety as this one obviously was.</p>

<p>Carrying it in his hand and still closed, the man
limped off down the trail that led toward the cove.</p>

<p>No sooner had he got well clear of the camp
than the four watchers began scrambling up the
trees nearest to them for the sake of a better view.
There was nobody to hear them, but under the impulse
of that caution which their presence in such
a place required of them, they were careful to climb
as silently as possible.</p>

<p>Very dimly, but with certainty, they could see
the glow of the closed dark lantern and in that way
trace the man carrying it throughout his brief
journey.</p>

<p>When at last he reached the mouth of the cove
where the view opened out toward the broad inlet,
he opened his lamp for a brief second, holding it
so that its gleam should show down the inlet to his
right. A moment later he flashed it again, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
time straight across the broad inlet. Presently he
opened it for the third time, sending the flash up
the inlet.</p>

<p>The whole proceeding did not occupy half a minute,
and after that all remained in darkness except
that the boys could still locate the dark lantern by
the dim halo of light that surrounded it.</p>

<p>For half an hour or more there were no further
developments. The man with the game leg seemed
to be sitting still, waiting for time to pass or for
something to happen. At last he opened the lamp
again, sending its flash down the inlet as before.
Then he showed his gleam straight out upon the
water.</p>

<p>This time the boys in the tree tops saw a brief
answering gleam from the open water half a mile
or more from shore.</p>

<p>It was safe for the boys to speak now, and Tom
thought it best for all of them to come down out
of the trees before the man with the game leg, who
had started slowly back toward the camp, should
reach their neighborhood.</p>

<p>“Come down off your roosts, fellows,” he directed,
“and secrete yourselves well in the bushes.
The ‘others’ are coming to-night, sure enough.
Be careful to hide yourselves so that a flash from
that dark lantern won’t search you out. By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
way, after they come and we see all we can, we
must get out of here. I can’t speak then, but notice
when you see me moving away, and follow my
example. Now, no more talking, even in a whisper.”</p>

<p>The man with the game leg did not return immediately,
as Tom had expected. Instead, he made
his way up the bank of the cove and around its
bend, to a point only two or three hundred
yards away. Obviously that was to be the landing
place, hidden as it was by the bend and
the dense forest growth from all possible observation
on the part of boats in the sound outside.
The man with the game leg had gone to the mouth
of the cove only to send his signals to his companions
outside. Now that they had been seen and
answered, he had gone to the landing-place, there
to await their coming.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the purposes of the boys, the
landing was in full view from their hiding place,
and after the man with the game leg had gone
thither they had only that one point to watch while
they waited.</p>

<p>The wait was a long one, and perhaps it seemed
longer because a drizzling rain had set in, soaking
them to the skin. After a long time, however, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
man with the game leg turned his dark lantern and
flashed it once down the cove.</p>

<p>By its light the watchers made out three large
boats slowly moving up the cove, apparently with
carefully muffled oars, as their strokes could not
be heard even at the short distance that now separated
them from their destination. As they approached
the landing with obvious care, there were
frequent flashes from the dark lanterns that all of
them seemed to be carrying, and by these flashes
Tom and his companions saw that the boats were
piled high with freight of some kind, so bestowed
as to occupy every inch of space except what was
necessary for the use of the men at the oars. Of
these there were only two in each boat, each plying
a single oar, while a third, perched upon a freight
pile at the stern, was steering. Thus there were
nine men in the three boats, who, with the man on
shore, constituted a rather formidable company for
four boys to face if they should decide to attack
the <i>Hunkydory’s</i> camp, as the man with the game
leg had threatened.</p>

<p>Whence the boats had come, Tom could not in
any wise guess, and of course he could not discuss
the matter with his comrades while hiding there in
the bushes under a life-and-death necessity of keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
perfectly silent. Two things he was sure of:
the boats could not have come very far, with
only two oarsmen to each of them, and they could
not have traversed any but smooth waters, with
their freight piled high above their gunwales, as it
was.</p>

<p>As soon as the boats were landed, the men began
unloading them and carrying their freight to the
camp, which was evidently to be its hiding place for
a time at least. In the main it seemed to consist
of light boxes or packages, many of them bound
together into single large bundles which one man
could carry. There were also some kegs, which
seemed pretty heavy, as the men carried them on
their shoulders. But it was difficult to make out
anything more definite than this, as the darkness
was dispelled infrequently by flashes from a dark
lantern, and then only for a fraction of a second at
a time.</p>

<p>When the greater part of the freight had been
brought to the camp the man who seemed to be in
authority over the rest set some of them to work
bestowing it in the hovels, of which there appeared
to be several, each securely hidden in the thick undergrowth
so that a person casually passing that
way would never have suspected their existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Even while this work was in progress the man in
charge permitted as little show of light as possible.
When all was done a hamper of provisions was
brought from one of the boats, together with a
demijohn, and the whole crew assembled around
the midnight spread, eating and drinking in the
dark, except when now and then it became necessary
to permit a little show of light for a moment.</p>

<p>At first they feasted in silence, too, but after
awhile the liquor they were drinking seemed to go
to their heads and they quarreled among themselves
a good deal. Some of them wandered about
now and then as if searching the bushes jealously.</p>

<p>It was clearly time for the boys to leave the
place and they watched and listened for Tom’s beginning
of the retreat. At last they heard him
moving and, assuming that he had begun the withdrawal,
they all cautiously crept away to the rear.
As each was following a separate trail there was
no word spoken among them until Larry, Dick and
Cal came out of the bushes and joined each other
at the gum tree.</p>

<p>“But where is Tom?” one of them asked.</p>

<p>Nobody knew. Nobody had seen or known
anything about him since his first stirring of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
bushes had set the retreat in motion. They had
all heard a commotion in what they called “the
scoundrels’ camp,” with sounds as of angry quarreling
and fighting; but they had heard nothing
of Tom.</p>

<p>The boys were in consternation.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose those scoundrels can have
caught him?” asked Dick, with horror in his tones.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Larry answered through his
set teeth. “But there’s only one thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Only one thing,” answered Dick. “We must
go to his assistance, and if they have him prisoner
we must rescue him or all die trying. I for one will
never come back alive unless we bring him with
us.”</p>

<p>“That’s of course,” said Cal, who for once
spoke crisply, wasting no words. “Wait a second,
Larry! How many cartridges have you&mdash;each
of you?”</p>

<p>When they answered, Cal said:</p>

<p>“Here, take six more apiece. You may need
’em.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he took the extra cartridges from his
pockets and hurriedly distributed them. It was
Cal’s rule in hunting never to be without abundant
ammunition.</p>

<p>“Now then, Larry,” he said, when the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
had pocketed the cartridges, “give your orders;
you’re the captain.”</p>

<p>“All right! Come on at a run, but don’t trip
and fall. There’s no time to lose.”</p>

<p>Down the trail they went, not at a run, for running
was impossible in such a tangle of vines and
bushes, but at as fast a trot as they could manage.
Suddenly there was a collision. Larry had
met Tom “head on,” as he afterwards said. Tom
was making his way as fast as he could to the
gum tree, knowing that his friends would be in
terror when they missed him, while they were hurrying
to his rescue. In the darkness and the heavy
downpour of rain he and Larry had failed to see
or hear each other till they came into actual collision.</p>

<p>“Where on earth have you been, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Why did you fellows retreat before the
time?”</p>

<p>These were questions instantly exchanged.</p>

<p>“Why, you gave the signal, Tom. You began
moving off and we followed as agreed.”</p>

<p>“I understand now,” Tom answered, resuming
the journey, “but it was a mistake of signal.
Come on out of here. Let’s go to camp and talk
it all over there. I’ve found out all about this
thing and it’s interesting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does it mean? Tell us!”</p>

<p>“Not here in the downpour. We’ll go to camp
first and get under the shelter and put on some dry
clothes. My teeth are chattering and I don’t care
to imitate them. Come on!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XII</h2>

<p class="pch">TOM’S DARING VENTURE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom’s</span> teeth were indeed chattering when the
company reached their camp. He was chilled
“clear through,” he said, and his companions were
very uneasy. They feared, and not without reason,
that he had contracted a swamp fever, which always
begins with a chill. To avoid that, the Rutledge
boys, who knew the coast and its dangers,
had carefully kept on or very near the salt water,
and had chosen for their camp a spot where there
were no live oaks, no gray moss and no black sand.
Still Tom might have caught a fever.</p>

<p>Cal piled wood on the fire with a lavish hand,
so that an abundance of heat might be reflected into
their dry bush shelter, the open side of which faced
the fire, and Dick busied himself searching out dry
clothes from the lockers, while Larry helped Tom
to strip himself as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>“Now run and jump into the creek,” he directed,
as soon as the last of Tom’s clothes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
off. “The salt water is luke-warm or even
warmer than that. I’ll wring out your clothes
while your bath is warming you, and when you
come out we’ll give you a rub down that would
stimulate circulation in a bronze statue. Hurry
into the water, and don’t hurry out too soon.”</p>

<p>By the time Tom had been rubbed down and
had got into dry clothes, he declared himself to
be “as warm as a toast, as hungry as a schoolgirl,
and ready to stand a rigid examination as to the
character and purposes of our scoundrel friends
down there.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Larry. “That’s proof
positive that you haven’t caught the fever. I was
afraid you might.”</p>

<p>“Fever? Why, I was as cold as the Arctic circle&mdash;but
then perhaps you keep your fevers on
ice down here and serve ’em cold. You have so
many queer ways that nothing surprises me.”</p>

<p>Larry explained, and Tom laughed at him for
his pains, for of course Tom knew what he had
meant.</p>

<p>It was well past midnight, and the others shared
Tom’s hunger in full measure, so they were not
greatly disappointed when, in response to their
eager demands for the story he had to tell, he
answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all about it when we get something
to eat. Till then my loquacity will closely
resemble that of a clam.”</p>

<p>One of the party had killed some fat black squirrels
during the preceding day, and as these were
already “dressed for the banquet,” in Dick’s
phrase, they were spread upon a mass of coals,
and within a brief while the meal&mdash;supper
or breakfast, or post-midnight luncheon, or whatever
else it might be called&mdash;was ready to receive
their attention.</p>

<p>“Now, Tom, tell us!” demanded Larry, when
their hunger was partially appeased.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” interposed Dick. “Isn’t this
rather risky?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Why, sitting here on our haunches, rejoicing
in the genial warmth of the fire&mdash;over-genial,
I should call it, as it’s blistering my knees&mdash;and
having no sentry out to see that the scoundrels
don’t pounce down on us by surprise.”</p>

<p>“There’s no more risk in it,” answered Tom,
confidently, “than in wearing socks, or playing
dominoes, or trying to trace out the features of the
man in the moon.”</p>

<p>“But why not, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Because the scoundrels down there are all dead&mdash;dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
drunk, I mean&mdash;and they have all they
can do just now in sleeping it off.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, entirely sure. You saw how they were
drinking&mdash;half a pint of rum at a dose, repeated
every five minutes. Well, they kept that up as
long as they could find the way to their mouths.
They had emptied the demijohn before you fellows
left, and not being satisfied, they got out a
keg of the fiery stuff, had a rough and tumble fight
over some question relating to it, beat each others’
faces into something very much like Hamburger
steaks, and then decided to let the keg arbitrate the
dispute. Four or five of them had been arbitrated
into a comatose state before I left, another was
trying to sing something about ‘Melinda,’ setting
forth that he had ‘seen her at the windah,’ and was
prepared to give his hat and boots if he could
‘only have been dah.’ The rest were drunkenly
silent as they sat there by an open dark lantern
which they had forgotten to close, I suppose, and
drinking rum from tin cups whenever they could
remember to do so. They will give nobody any
trouble to-night.”</p>

<p>“But, Tom,” interposed Dick, “how do you
know it was rum they were drinking?”</p>

<p>“Now, see here,” said Tom, “I’d like to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
who’s telling this story. If I’m the one the rest
of you had better let me tell it in my own way.
I was going to begin at the beginning and tell it
straight through, but your intrusive questions have
switched me off the track. Now listen, and I’ll
tell you all I know and how I know it, and what
I think of it, and what I think you think of it, and
all the rest of it.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Tom!” said Cal; “I’ll keep the
peace for you; you’ll bear me witness that I haven’t
spoken a word since you began. Go on!”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Tom. “I thought you were
about to give us a disquisition when you began to
say that, but you didn’t, so I’ll forgive you. Well,
you see when you fellows heard me moving out
there in the thicket and thought I was instituting
a retreat, I was only changing my base, as the military
men say. I had seen something that aroused
my curiosity, and my curiosity is like a baby after
midnight&mdash;if you once rouse it, you simply can’t
coax it to go to sleep again.”</p>

<p>“What was it you had seen, Tom?” Larry began.</p>

<p>“Silence!” commanded Cal. “Tom has the
floor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg pardon&mdash;” Larry began apologetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, don’t do even that. Go on, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I will as soon as you two twin brothers cease
your quarreling. As I was saying, I had seen something
that aroused my curiosity. As I was peering
through the bushes, looking toward the main
body of the roisterers, I saw the limping one slip
away from the general company and sneak off.
He went very cautiously through the undergrowth
to the hovel nearest me and entered it, closing the
door after him. I could see a little pencil of light
streaming out through a crack, so I knew he
had opened his lamp in there. After a little fumbling
he came out again, but he was so drunk he
forgot to take his lamp with him, as I discovered
by the continued streaming out of that little pencil
of light.</p>

<p>“That was what aroused my curiosity. I
wanted to know what was in that hovel, and as
the lame gentleman with the ‘load’ on had obligingly
left his lamp there for my accommodation,
I resolved to embrace the opportunity offered. I
moved cautiously upon the enemy’s works. That
is to say, I crept forward toward the hovel.
That’s what you fellows mistook for the signal to
retreat.</p>

<p>“Now I am convinced that our temporary
neighbors, the scoundrels, are disposed to be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
all ways obliging. At any rate they had considerately
placed the door of the hovel so that it fronted
my side of the structure and not theirs. Thus,
when I opened the door the light from the burning
lamp did not shine toward them and thus give
the alarm.</p>

<p>“I entered the place and rather minutely examined
its contents.”</p>

<p>“What was in there?” asked Cal, forgetting in
his eagerness that he had himself undertaken to
prevent the interruption of Tom’s narrative by
questions from any source.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you about that when I come to it.
Story first, Cal.</p>

<p>“I had just finished my inspection when I heard
footsteps of rather uncertain purpose passing
round the hovel toward the door, which of course
I had closed behind me. As there is only one
door to that hovel and it has no windows by which
‘lovers might enter or burglars elope’&mdash;that’s
wrong end first but it’s no matter&mdash;I realized that
there was no time to lose. I hurriedly settled down
behind a pile of cigar boxes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Their plunder is cigars, then?” asked Dick,
forgetting.</p>

<p>“I did not say so,” Tom answered teasingly.
“I made no mention of cigars, so far as I can remember.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
I spoke only of cigar boxes. They
might be filled with anything, you know. At any
rate your interruption has spoiled the most thrilling
part of my narrative, which must now be continued
prosaically and without the dramatic fire
and fervor I had planned to put into it.</p>

<p>“My concealment was hasty and at best very
imperfect. In my haste I forgot to conceal my
gun, which stuck up a foot or two above the barrier
of boxes that imperfectly hid my person.
Fortunately, however, the lame gentleman was too
blind drunk even to see double and, as he made
no mention of the matter, I refrained from alluding
to it.</p>

<p>“Apparently he had entered the hovel with a
single purpose, namely, to close his lantern and
take it away. With what I cannot help regarding
as praiseworthy persistence, he carried out that
purpose, giving heed to nothing else. He omitted
even to close the door after him, and as the place
was without heating apparatus of any kind&mdash;except
rum for internal combustion&mdash;I took my
leave as soon as I felt confident that the lame gentleman
had either rejoined his comrades or had
fallen into dreamless slumber on his way to do
so. My next adventure was the head-on collision
with Larry in the trail.”</p>

<p>Tom paused, took another bite at the squirrel’s
leg he had been eating between sentences, and it
seemed necessary to set him going again by means
of questions.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go on, Tom? You haven’t
told us yet what you found in the hut.”</p>

<p>“I’m thirsty,” answered the boy. “Speaking
is dry work, as you know, if you ever read Hawthorn’s
‘A Rill from the Town Pump!’ Have
we enough water in the spring, Cal, for me to waste
it in slaking my thirst?”</p>

<p>“We’ve caught all our things full, I reckon.
I’ll see.”</p>

<p>When Cal returned he brought with him a small
supply of rain water.</p>

<p>“What made you so long about it, Cal?” asked
Larry. “We’re all waiting for you.”</p>

<p>“So I see,” answered Cal. “I make all required
apologies for having kept this distinguished
company waiting while I attended to some matters
that are even more vitally interesting to all of us
than is Tom’s promised inventory of the things discovered
by him in the tents of the wicked, if I
may so designate a slab hovel in a cane brake.”</p>

<p>“What have you been doing, Cal? And why
didn’t you call the rest of us to help you?” asked
Dick, whose New England conscience was apt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
scourge his spirit if he thought he had been doing
less than his share of whatever there was to do.</p>

<p>“I’ll reply to your questions in inverse order,”
Cal replied. “I did not call for help because I
did not need help. In what I had to do one person
was as good as a dozen. I may have been a trifle
slow about it, but that is chiefly because water won’t
run through a hole faster than nature intended it
to do. As for your other question, I’ve been engaged
in a job of water-supply engineering. All
the receptacles I set to catch water were nearly
full, and as it still rains&mdash;a fact that you may
have observed for yourselves&mdash;I thought it best
to empty their contents into the water kegs and
set them to catch more. As nobody thought to
bring a funnel along, I have had to resort to simpler
methods, and I have found that it is by no
means easy to pour water from a four-gallon bait
pail into a one-inch bung hole without spilling it.
For the rest, Captain Larry, I beg to report that
one of our water kegs is now full and the other
perhaps one-third full. I hope to catch enough
more water before the rain ceases to finish filling
that keg and to serve all camp purposes during
the few hours that we shall probably remain
here.”</p>

<p>“Why, I should think we might stay as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
we like, now,” said Tom; “this rain must have
filled up our spring.”</p>

<p>“It has, and it has spoiled it for use for many
days to come.”</p>

<p>“But how?” persisted Tom.</p>

<p>“Let me remind you, Tom, that we are all eagerly
waiting for you to tell us some things that
are distinctly more interesting to us than the condition
and prospects of a swamp spring can be
when we’ve enough water for our present and immediate
future need. Go on with your story.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the story is finished,” Tom replied, “but
you want to hear about the contents of the hovel.
They consist in part of little kegs&mdash;three or five
gallon kegs, I should think&mdash;of Santa Cruz Rum.
At least that’s what I made out the letters branded
on them to mean. These kegs are lying on the
ground in rows that impressed me as far more
orderly than the scoundrels themselves ever think
of being. I should say there are fifteen or twenty
of the kegs in that hovel.</p>

<p>“The rest of the stuff consists of cigars in boxes,
and the boxes are carefully tied together in parcels&mdash;thirty
boxes to the parcel. That’s the way
we all saw them carry them up from their boats.”</p>

<p>“Where on earth can they have got all that rum
and all those cigars, anyhow? And what do they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
bring them away down here in the woods for, I
wonder?” speculated Dick. “What’s your guess,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“Pirates,” answered Tom; “and those things
are their plunder.”</p>

<p>“Curious sort of pirates,” said Cal, scoffingly.
“Unlike any pirates I ever heard of. Why, Tom,
did you ever hear of pirates contenting themselves
with taking the rum and cigars they found on the
ships they overhauled? You’ve got to guess two
or three times more if you’re going to guess
right.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think they are?” asked
Tom, a trifle disappointed to find his theory
bowled over so easily.</p>

<p>“Smugglers,” answered Cal. “And I don’t
just think it either&mdash;I know.”</p>

<p>“But, Cal,” interrupted Larry, “smugglers
must bring their goods from foreign ports, and
we all know enough about boats to know that those
flat-bottomed tubs of theirs wouldn’t live five minutes
in a little blow on blue water.”</p>

<p>“No, nor five seconds either, and those precious
rascals know all that quite as well as we do. For
that reason, among others, they refrain from risking
their valuable lives by venturing upon blue
water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then how do they carry on their traffic?”</p>

<p>“I have often remonstrated with you, Larry,
for your neglect to read the newspapers. But for
that you might have been as well informed on
this and other subjects as I am. About a month
ago I read in a New York newspaper that fell
in my way a somewhat detailed account of the way
in which certain kinds of smuggling is carried on
along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts wherever the conditions
are favorable, and the conditions are nowhere
so favorable as right here on this South
Carolina coast, where deep, but often very narrow
and crooked, inlets and creeks open from the
broader waters of the sounds directly into densely
wooded regions that are often wholly unpeopled
for many miles in every direction.</p>

<p>“This is the way they do it: Schooners and
other small sea-going craft load at West Indian
ports and take out clearance papers for New York
or Halifax or some other big port which can be
best reached by skirting this coast. Under pretense
of stress of weather, or shortness of water
or provisions, they put into some harbor of
refuge like that sound out there. They make
no effort to land anything, and if questioned
by the revenue officers they can show perfectly
regular papers. Then when opportunity offers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
their shore gangs&mdash;like the one over there&mdash;slip
out in the darkness, take on full loads of
freight, and land it in some secluded spot like the
one down there, and the schooner sails away to her
destination.”</p>

<p>“But how do they get their goods from the
woods to market?” Tom asked.</p>

<p>“By wagons, I suppose, and a little at a time.
That doesn’t concern us very deeply. What does
concern us, is that we’ve got to get away from here
as soon as this rain stops. The clouds seem to be
breaking, by the way, and the wind has shifted to
the northwest,” said Cal, stepping out of the shelter
to observe the weather. “It will clear pretty
early in the morning, I think, and in the meantime
I for one want to get a little sleep.”</p>

<p>“But what’s the hurry, Cal?” asked Tom.
“Why can’t we stay here a day or two longer?
I’d like to see what the smugglers do when they
come to.”</p>

<p>“There are several reasons for getting away
at once,” answered Cal. “For one thing, we’re
running short of some necessary supplies and
must go to Beaufort to replenish our stores. Then
there’s the question of water supply. After I
finish filling the kegs we’ll have barely enough left
to get through the day on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“But how has the rain put the spring out of
commission, Cal?” asked Tom. “You promised
to explain that.”</p>

<p>“By filling it full of surface water. It will be
a week or more before the water there is fit to
drink, at least as a steady diet.”</p>

<p>“There’s a much better reason than that,” said
Larry.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Why, we must hurry to put ourselves in communication
with the authorities, so that they can
come down on that place before the scoundrels
get away, or get their plunder away.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tom, who was reluctant to leave
the place and give up the adventure, “I suppose
we ought to do that.”</p>

<p>“Ought to? Why, we simply must. Every
decent citizen owes it as a duty to give notice of
crime when he discovers it, and to aid the officers
of the law in stopping it. Civilized life would
come to an end if men generally refused to support
the authorities in their efforts to enforce the law.
We’ve discovered a den of thieves, engaged in robbing
the Government&mdash;that is to say, robbing all
of us. So we’ll get away from here just as early
in the morning as we can. Now let’s get some
sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>It was easy to say, “Let’s get some sleep,” but
not easy to get it in the excited condition of mind
that had come upon every member of the little
party. But, by keeping silence and lying still, the
weary fellows did manage to sleep a little after
awhile, and it was the sun shining full in their
faces that at last aroused them to a busy day.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">CAL’S EXPERIENCE AS THE PRODIGAL SON</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breakfast</span> next morning was not a very satisfactory
meal. There was plenty of fish and
game, of course, but there was little else. The
coffee supply had been used up, but the boys regarded
that as a matter of no consequence.</p>

<p>“Coffee is a mere luxury anyhow,” Dick said,
“and we can go without it as well as not. It isn’t
like being without bread or substitutes for bread.
If we had some sweet potatoes now, or some
rice&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The which we haven’t,” interrupted Cal. “No
more can we get any here. As for corn meal, we
have enough for one more ash cake, but it is full of
weevil and, therefore, when we consume it we shall
be eating the bread of bitterness in an entirely literal
sense. For quinine biscuit would taste like
cookies as compared with weevely corn bread. You
were wise in your generation, Dick, when you surreptitiously
placed that tin of ship biscuit on board,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
but your imagination lacked breadth and comprehensiveness.
It was not commensurate with our
appetites, and so the ship bread is all consumed and
would have been if you’d brought a barrel of it on
board instead of that little tin box full. You
neglected that, however, and we must endure the
consequences as best we may.”</p>

<p>“For the present, yes,” said Larry; “but not for
long. We must make all the haste we can till we
get to Beaufort and stock up again.”</p>

<p>“I know a trick worth two of that,” Cal said
apart to Dick, but he did not explain himself. Dick
had found out, however, that Cal’s knowledge of
the region round about them and of the tortuous
waterways that interlaced the coast in every direction
was singularly minute and accurate. It was
not until that morning, however, that Cal explained
to him how he had come to be so well versed in the
geography and hydrography of the region. It had
been decided by Captain Larry that before leaving
their present camp that day the company should
cook enough food to last for a day or two, so that
they might not have to waste any time hunting or
fishing while making as quick a trip to Beaufort as
they could. As there was very little game left after
breakfast, Cal and Dick set out with their guns to
secure a supply of squirrels and whatever else they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
could find, while Larry and Tom should load the
boat and catch some fish.</p>

<p>During this little shooting expedition some small
manifestation of Cal’s minute information prompted
a question from Dick.</p>

<p>“How on earth, Cal, can you remember every little
detail like that? And how did you learn so
much about things around here, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I got that part of my education,” Cal answered,
“partly by being a very good boy and partly by
being a very bad one. I’m inclined to think the
bad-boy influence contributed even more than the
good-boy experience to my store of information.
As for remembering things, that is a habit of mind
easily cultivated, though the great majority of people
neglect it. It consists mainly in careful observation.
When people tell you they don’t remember
things they have seen, or remember them only
vaguely, it usually means that they did not observe
the things seen. For example, I remembered where
that spring of ours was when we were all parched
with thirst, and I knew how to go to it in the dark.
That was simply because when I first saw that
spring and quenched a very lively thirst there, I decided
to remember it and its surroundings in case
I should ever have occasion to find it again. So I
looked carefully at everything round about from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
every point of view. I observed that the spring lay
just beyond the first bend of the creek and that there
was a cluster of big cypress trees very near it. I
noticed that the mouth of the creek lay between a
little stretch of beach on one side and a dense cane
thicket on the other. In short, I carefully observed
all the bearings, and having done that, of course I
could never forget how to find the spring.”</p>

<p>“Do you always do that sort of thing when you
think you may want to find a place again?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. Indeed, I do it anyhow,
whether there is any occasion or not. For example,
when I was visiting you in Boston last year I noticed
that there was a little dent in the silver cap over the
speaking tube in the dining-room, as if somebody
had hit it a little blow. The dent was triangular, I
remember.”</p>

<p>“That’s because the thing I hit it with had a triangular
face, for I made that dent when I was a
little fellow with a curious-looking tool that a repairer
of old furniture had in use there. It’s curious
that you should have noticed the dent, as it is
very small and your back was toward it as you sat
at table.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not as I entered the room. It was
then that I saw it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then that sort of close observation is a habit of
mind with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I suppose it is partly natural and partly
cultivated. I don’t know.”</p>

<p>The two had come by this time to that part of the
woods that Tom had named the “squirrel pasture,”
and they were soon busy with their guns. But as
they walked back toward the camp, loaded with
black and gray squirrels, Dick came back to the subject,
which seemed deeply to interest him.</p>

<p>“I wonder, Cal,” he said, “if you would mind
telling me about those two epochs in your young life&mdash;the
good-boy and the bad-boy periods?”</p>

<p>Cal laughed, half under his breath.</p>

<p>“It isn’t much to tell,” he replied; “but if you’re
interested I’ll tell you about it. You see the old
families down here are a good deal mixed up in their
relationships, just as the old families in Massachusetts
are, because of frequent intermarriages. The
Rutledges and the Calhouns, and the Hugers, and
the Huguenins, and Barnwells, and Haywards, and
the rest, are all more or less related to each other.
Indeed, there is such a tangle of relationships that
I long ago gave up trying to work out the puzzle.
It is enough for you to know that the particular
Mr. Hayward who owns all this wild land around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
here and half a dozen plantations besides is my kinsman&mdash;my
mother’s uncle, I believe. Anyhow,
from my earliest childhood there was never anything
that I liked so well as visiting at Uncle Hayward’s.
Perfect candor compels me to say that I
was not particularly fond of Uncle Hayward or
of any member of the family, for that matter.
Uncle Hayward used to take me for long rides on
a marsh tackey by way of entertaining me in the
way he thought I liked best, and I resented that
whenever I wanted to do something else instead.
He is one of the best and kindliest men alive and
I am very fond of him now, but when I was a little
fellow I thought he interfered with my own plans
too much, and so I made up my mind that I didn’t
like him. As for the ladies of the family, I detested
them because they were always combing my
hair and ‘dressing me up’ when I didn’t want to be
dressed up.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, nothing delighted me like a prolonged
visit at Uncle Hayward’s. That was because
I particularly appreciated an intimate association
with Sam. Sam was a black boy&mdash;or young man,
rather&mdash;who seemed to me to be the most delightfully
accomplished person I had ever known. He
could roll his eyes up until only the white below the
iris was visible. He could stand on his head, walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
on his hands, turn handsprings, and disjoint himself
in the most astonishing fashion imaginable.
He could move his scalp and wiggle his ears. His
gifts and accomplishments in such ways as these
seemed to me without limit.</p>

<p>“As Uncle Hayward could never keep Sam out
of the woods, he made up his mind to assign him
to duty in the woods as a sort of ranger. There
was plenty for Sam to do there, for besides all these
vast tracts of wild land, Uncle Hayward had a deer
park consisting of many thousand acres of woodland
under a single fence. To watch for fires, to
keep poachers out, to catch and tame half a dozen
marsh tackeys every now and then, and a score of
similar duties were assigned to Sam.</p>

<p>“When I was a little fellow my customary reward
for being a particularly ‘good boy’ for a season
was permission to go into the woods with Sam
and live like a wild creature for weeks at a time.
In that way, and under Sam’s tuition, I learned
much about these regions and about the waterways,
for Sam seemed always to know where a boat of
some kind lay hidden, and he and I became tireless
navigators and explorers.</p>

<p>“That, in brief, is the history of the ‘good-boy’
epoch. The story of the other is a trifle more
dramatic, perhaps. It occurred three or four years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
ago when Larry and I were planning to go to Virginia
to prepare for college. I was fourteen or fifteen
years old then and I had continued to spend a
part of every year down here in the woods with
Sam for guide, servant, and hunting factotum. At
the time I speak of I had some rather ‘lame ducks’
in my studies. The fact is, I had idled a good deal,
while Larry had mastered all the tasks set him.
Accordingly, when my father and mother went
North that year&mdash;they go every summer on account
of mother’s health&mdash;Larry went up country
to visit some of our relatives there, while I decided
to stay at home and work with a tutor whom my
father had hired for me.</p>

<p>“He and I lived alone in the house with only the
servants, and I found him to be in many ways disagreeable.
He was an Englishman, for one thing,
and at that period of my life I had not yet got over
the detestation of Englishmen which the school histories
and revolutionary legends had instilled into
my mind. He was brusque and even unmannerly
at times, judged by the standards of courtesy that
we Carolinians accept. More important than all
else, he and I entertained irreconcilable views as to
our relations with each other. He thought he was
employed to be my master, while I held that he was
hired only as my tutor. This led to some friction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
but we managed to get on together for a time until
I found that the difference of opinion between him
and me extended to other things than our personal
relations. He seemed to think himself not only my
master but master of the house also in my father’s
absence. He did not know how to treat the servants.
He gave them orders in a harsh, peremptory
way to which house servants in Carolina are
not accustomed. His manner with them was rather
that of an ox-driver toward his cattle than that of
a gentleman dealing with well-mannered and well-meaning
servants.</p>

<p>“This grated on me, and I suppose I have a pretty
well-defined temper when occasion arouses it. The
Rutledges generally have. At any rate I one day
remonstrated with the tutor on the subject, intending
the remonstrance to be all there was of the incident,
but he answered me in that tone of a master
which I more and more resented. High words followed,
from which he learned my opinion of his
character and manners much more definitely than
I had cared to express it before.</p>

<p>“At last he threatened me with a flogging, and
picked up a cane with which to administer it. I
was mad all over and clear through by that time.
I had never had a flogging and I certainly would
not submit to one at his hands. But my anger had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
passed beyond expression in words by that time.
I did not feel the flush of it&mdash;I felt deathly pale
instead. I was no longer hot; on the contrary I
was never cooler in my life. I did not threaten
my antagonist or give him warning as he advanced
toward me with the cane uplifted. I simply selected
a certain plank in the floor which I made up
my mind should be his Rubicon. I stood perfectly
still, waiting for him to cross it.</p>

<p>“Presently he stepped across the line I had fixed
upon. The instant he did so I sprang upon him,
delivering my blows so fast and furiously that in
two or three seconds he went down in a heap. He
claimed to be an expert boxer, and I suppose he was,
but my attack was so sudden and so unexpected that
his science seemed to have no chance. At any rate,
he was so nearly ‘knocked out’ that he had no disposition
to renew the contest. He went to his room,
washed himself, packed his trunk, leaving it to be
called for later, and left the house.</p>

<p>“Before leaving he wrote me a curt note, saying
that he would immediately get a warrant for my
arrest on a charge of assault and battery.</p>

<p>“That rather staggered me. I wouldn’t have
given one inch in fear of that man. No power on
earth could have made me run away from him or
apologize to him or in any other way flinch from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
anything he might do to me. But I had a terrifying
misconception of the law and its processes. I
was only a fifteen-year-old boy, you know, and I
knew nothing whatever of legal proceedings; or
rather, I knew just enough about them to mislead
my mind. I knew that a warrant meant arrest, and
as I lay abed worrying that night I convinced myself
that if I should be arrested when my father
was not in Charleston to furnish bail for me, I must
lie in a loathsome jail until his return, forbidden to
communicate with anybody and compelled to live
on a diet of bread and water.</p>

<p>“I saw no way out except to keep out of reach
of that warrant till my father’s return, and the only
secure way of doing that, I thought, was to run
away and live down here in the woods. So after
lying awake all night I got up at daybreak, got one
of the servants to give me breakfast and put up a
luncheon for me. Then I took a little, flat-bottomed
skiff that I owned and made my way
down here. I had some money with me, but I did
not dare go to any town, or village, or country
store, to buy anything lest the man with the warrant
should find out where I was. I learned where
all the little negro settlements were, however, and
there I bought sweet potatoes and the like as I
needed them. I had my shotgun and fish lines with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
me, of course, and so I had no difficulty in feeding
myself. For amusement I wandered about in every
direction by land and water, and in that way greatly
improved my education in coast country geography.</p>

<p>“After a while I found myself running short of
ammunition, and I didn’t know how to procure a
fresh supply. I was afraid to go to Beaufort, or
up to Grahamville, or Coosawhatchie, or anywhere
else where there were stores, and besides that I was
in no fit condition to go anywhere. I had forgotten
to bring any clothes with me and what I had on
were worn literally to rags.</p>

<p>“Fortunately I had got acquainted with a negro
boy who often brought me vegetables and fruit and
sold them to me for low prices. I suppose now that
he stole them, although that didn’t occur to me
then.</p>

<p>“One day I hit upon the plan of sending him to
Beaufort for ammunition. He expressed doubt
that anybody there would sell it to him, and I shared
the doubt. But it was my only chance, so I gave
him some money and sent him. He was gone for
two days, during which I fired my last cartridge at
a deer and missed him. I had begun to think the
negro boy had simply pocketed the money and disappeared,
never to return again, but I consoled myself
with the thought that there were plenty of fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and oysters to be had, and that I could buy sweet
potatoes and vegetables.</p>

<p>“That night the negro boy returned, bringing
me rather more ammunition than I had sent for,
and when I questioned him about the matter his
reply was that that was what the storekeeper had
given him for the money. Later, however, he confessed
to me that finding nobody willing to sell
cartridges to him, he had simply stolen them and,
being prepared to bring me the goods I had sent for,
he thought the money he had saved in that way
justly belonged to him. He had squandered it for
candy and in satisfaction of such other desires as
possessed him. Of course I paid the merchant afterwards,
and equally of course it was impossible
to collect the amount from the boy.</p>

<p>“All that is an episode. One day by some chance
I encountered Sam in my wanderings, and he told
me people were looking for me&mdash;that my father
had heard of my disappearance and had hurried
back to Charleston.</p>

<p>“I went to Beaufort, bought some sort of clothes,
and like the other prodigal son, returned to my
father. But he utterly failed to play his part according
to the story. Instead of falling on my neck,
he laughed at the clothes I wore. Instead of killing
the fatted calf, he told me to take a bath and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
on something fit to wear. All that evening I heard
him chuckling under his breath as I related my experiences
in answer to his questions. Finally he
said to me:</p>

<p>“‘You’ll do, Cal. I’ll never feel uneasy about
you again. You know how to take care of yourself.’</p>

<p>“There, Dick, you’ve heard the whole story, both
of my righteousness and of my wickedness.”</p>

<p>“And a mighty interesting story it has been to
me,” Dick replied. “Thank you for telling it.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">CAL RELATES A FABLE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Hunkydory</i> was completely loaded when Cal
and Dick returned, and there was nothing further
to do except cook the fish and game, so that there
might be no need to stop anywhere to get dinner.</p>

<p>There was a fairly stiff breeze blowing when the
anchors were weighed, but sailing was impracticable
until the boat should be well out of the narrow
creek, so all hands went to the oars.</p>

<p>When the land was cleared, Larry ordered that
the oars be stowed in their fastenings and the sails
raised. Without discussion or arrangement of any
kind, Cal went to the helm. It seemed the proper
thing to do in view of his superior knowledge of
the surroundings, but Cal was not thinking of that.
He had a plan and purpose of his own to carry out,
though he said nothing about the matter.</p>

<p>There was quite an hour of sailing necessary before
the course could be laid in the direction of the
waterway that led toward Beaufort, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
time came for heading in that direction, Cal laid
quite a different course, heading for a shore that lay
several miles away.</p>

<p>Larry was dozing in the forepeak and did not at
first observe on what course his brother was sailing.
When at last he did notice it, he assumed that something
in the direction of the wind made Cal’s course
desirable, but after a glance at the sails he changed
his mind.</p>

<p>“Why are you heading in that direction, Cal?”
he asked, looking about him. “Your course will
take us several miles out of our way. Head her
toward the point of land over there where the palmettos
are.”</p>

<p>Cal made no change and he waited a full minute
before he answered. When he did so it was in his
most languid drawl.</p>

<p>“Larry,” he said, quite as if he had not heard
a word that his brother had uttered, “there was a
schooner sailing down the Hudson River one day.
The captain of that craft was a Dutchman of phlegmatic
temperament and extreme obstinacy. The
mate was a Yankee, noted for his alert readiness of
resource. The schooner was loaded with brick.
The captain was loaded with beer. The mate
wasn’t loaded at all. It was the captain’s business
to steer and manage things in the after half of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
ship. It was the function of the mate to manage
things forward. But when the mate saw that the
schooner’s course was carrying her straight upon
the rocks, he went aft and remonstrated with the
captain. For reply the captain said:</p>

<p>“‘Mate, you go forward and run your end of the
schooner and leave me to run my end.’</p>

<p>“The mate went forward and ordered the anchor
heaved overboard. Then going aft again, he
said:</p>

<p>“‘Captain, I have anchored my end of the
schooner; you can do what you please with your
end.’”</p>

<p>Cal ceased, as if he had finished speaking. The
others laughed at the story, and Larry said:</p>

<p>“What’s the moral of that yarn, Cal?”</p>

<p>“<i>Haec fabula docet</i>,” replied Cal, “that <i>I’m</i> sailing
the <i>Hunkydory</i> just now; that I know where we
are going and why.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind telling us, then?” demanded
Larry.</p>

<p>“Not in the least. We are heading for the
shore, on our lee; as for why, there are several
reasons: One is that the tide will turn pretty soon,
and when it does it will run out of the creek you
want me to enter as fast as it does out of the Bay
of Fundy. Another is, that the wind is falling and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
we shall have to take to the oars presently. Another
is, that I am persuaded it will be easier rowing
across the small current out here than against a tide
that rushes out of the creek like a mill tail. There
are other and controlling reasons, but I have already
given you as many as your intellectual digestion
can assimilate. The rest will keep till we’re
comfortably ashore. There, that’s the last puff of
the wind.”</p>

<p>With that he hauled the boom inboard, let go
the halyards and left the rudder-bar.</p>

<p>“It is now after three o’clock,” he said, while the
others were unstepping the mast, “and the distance
is about three miles or a trifle less. Rowing easily
we shall have time after we get there to settle ourselves
comfortably before nightfall.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re right, of course,” Larry answered,
“but it means several more meals on meat
and fish alone.”</p>

<p>“Better not cross that bridge till you come to it,
Larry. You see we might find manna over there,
or some bread-fruit trees newly imported from Tahiti&mdash;who
knows?”</p>

<p>The others shared Larry’s regret as to the food
prospect, but they all recognized Cal’s superior
knowledge of conditions as a controlling consideration;
so all rowed on in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>When at last they reached the neighborhood of
the shore, Cal began scrutinizing it closely as if
searching for the landing place he had selected in
his mind. He was in fact looking for the very narrow
and cane-hidden entrance to a land-locked bay
that he remembered very well. Presently he turned
into it and shot the boat through a channel that one
might have passed a dozen times without seeing it.
It wound about among the dense growths for a
little way and then opened out into a considerable
little bay.</p>

<p>Here Cal directed the landing, but instead of arranging
to anchor the boat a little way from shore
he put on all speed with the oars and ran her hard
and fast upon a gently sloping beach.</p>

<p>“What’s that for, Cal?” asked Dick, whose
nautical instincts were offended by the manœuvre.</p>

<p>“To save trouble,” Cal answered. “You see
this is a considerable little bay, and the entrance to
it is so very narrow that before much of a flood
tide can run into the broad basin the time comes for
it to turn and run out again, so there is never a
rise and fall of more than six or eight inches in
here. The boat will lie comfortably where she is
so long as we choose to stay here. We can reach
her without much if any wading, and we can shove
her off into deep water whenever we like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is there a spring about here?” asked Tom,
whose concern about water supply had become specially
active.</p>

<p>“No, but we can make one in fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>Then selecting a sort of depression in the sandy
beach about sixty yards from the water’s edge, Cal
said:</p>

<p>“We have only to scoop out a basin in the sand
here&mdash;about three feet deep as I reckon it, and
we’ll have all the water we want.”</p>

<p>“But will it be good water?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly good. You see, Tom, this beach is
composed of clean white sand. The water in the
bay sipes through it at a uniform level, and we’ve
only to dig down to that level in order to get at it.”</p>

<p>“But won’t it be salt water?”</p>

<p>“Slightly brackish, perhaps, or possibly not at
all so. You see before reaching this point it is filtered
through sixty or seventy yards of closely
packed sand, which takes up all the salt and would
take up all other impurities if there were any, as
there are not. Suppose you dig for the water, Tom,
while the other fellows make camp and pick up
wood. It’s very easy digging and it won’t take
long. I’m going off a little way to see what there
is to see&mdash;and to look for the manna I spoke of a
while ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, Cal took up his gun and set out inland.
It was more than an hour before he returned and
the dusk was falling. But to the astonishment of
the others a string of young negroes followed close
upon his heels, all carrying burdens of some sort,
mostly poised upon their heads.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XV</h2>

<p class="pch">CAL GATHERS THE MANNA</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Cal appeared at the head of his dusky
little caravan the others advanced to meet him and
bombard him with a rapid fire of questions as to
where he had been, and what the negro boys were
carrying, and where he had discovered the source
of supply, and whatever else their curiosity suggested.</p>

<p>Instead of replying at once he asked.</p>

<p>“Did you find the water, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Yes, easily, and it isn’t brackish at all.”</p>

<p>“That’s excellent, and now let us eat, drink and
be merry. I couldn’t give you that injunction till
I learned that we had the water for the drinking
part.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for him to finish his sentence
the others busied themselves in examining what the
negroes had brought. As they did so, Cal catalogued
the supplies orally with comments:</p>

<p>“That bag contains a half bushel of rice&mdash;enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to serve us as a breadstuff for a long time
to come, as we require only three teacupfuls&mdash;measured
by guess&mdash;for a meal; the bag by the
side of it is badly out at elbows and knees, but it
holds a fine supply of new sweet potatoes which will
help the endurance of the rice. What’s that? Oh,
that’s a little okra, and the red-turbaned old darky
woman who sold it to me carefully explained how
to cook the mucilaginous vegetable. As she delivered
her instructions in the language of the Upper
Congo, I cannot say that my conception of the way
in which okra should be prepared for the table is
especially clear, but we’ll find some way out of that
difficulty. Yes, the big bag on the right contains
a few dozen ears of green corn, and the one next to
it is full of well-ripened tomatoes, smooth of surface,
shapely of contour and tempting to the appetite.
Finally, we have here half a dozen cantaloupes,
or ‘mush millions,’ as the colored youth
who supplied them called his merchandise. Now
scamper, you little vagabonds. I’ve paid you once
for toting the things and it is a matter of principle
with me never to pay twice for a single service.”</p>

<p>“Where on earth, Cal, did you find all these
things?” asked Larry, the others looking the same
question out of their eyes as it were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“I found them in the garden patches where they
were grown,” he replied. “That’s what I went out
to do. They are the ‘manna,’ the finding of which
somewhere in this neighborhood I foreshadowed in
answer to your querulous predictions of an exclusively
meat diet for some days to come.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Cal was throwing sweet potatoes
into the fire and covering them with red-hot ashes
with glowing coals on top.</p>

<p>“You’re a most unsatisfactory fellow, Cal,”
said Dick. “Why don’t you tell us where you got
the provender and how you happened to find so rich
a source of supply. Anybody else would be eager
to talk about such an exploit.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” Cal answered, “as soon as I get
the potato roast properly going. I’m hungry.
Suppose you cut some cantaloupes for us to eat
while the potatoes are cooking.”</p>

<p>Not until he had half a melon in hand did Cal
begin.</p>

<p>“There’s one of the finest rice plantations on all
this coast about a mile above here. Or rather, the
plantation house is there. As for the plantation
itself, we’re sitting on it now. It belongs to Colonel
Huguenin, and of course the house is closed in summer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why?” interrupted Dick, whose thirst for information
concerning southern customs was insatiable.</p>

<p>“Do you really want me to interrupt my story
of ‘How Cal Went Foraging’ in order to answer
your interjected inquiry? If I must talk it’s all one
to me what I talk about. So make your choice.”</p>

<p>“Go on and tell us of the foraging. The other
thing can wait.”</p>

<p>“Well, then; I happened to know of this plantation.
I’ve bivouacked on the shores of this bay before,
and when I turned the <i>Hunkydory’s</i> nose in
this direction I was impelled by an intelligent purpose.
I had alluring visions of the things I could
buy from the negroes up there at the quarters.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell us then instead of getting
off all that rigmarole about rowing against the tide
and the rest of it?” asked Larry, not with irritation,
but with a laugh, for the cantaloupe he was
eating and the smell of the sweet potatoes roasting
in the ashes had put him and the others into an entirely
peaceful and contented frame of mind.</p>

<p>“I never like to raise hopes,” answered Cal,
“that I cannot certainly fulfill. Performance is
better than promises&mdash;as much better as the supper
we are about to eat is better than a printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
bill of fare. Wonder how the potatoes are coming
on?”</p>

<p>With that he dug one of the yams out of the
ashes, examined it, and put it back, saying:</p>

<p>“Five or six minutes more will do the business.
I picked out the smallest ones on purpose to hurry
supper. Let’s set the table. Tom, if your kettle
of water is boiling, suppose you shuck some corn
and plunge it in it. It must boil from five to six
minutes&mdash;just long enough to get it thoroughly
hot through. If it boils longer the sweetness all
goes out of it. Dick, won’t you wash some of the
tomatoes while Larry and I arrange the dishes?”</p>

<p>Arranging the dishes consisted in cutting a number
of broad palmete leaves, some to hold the supplies
of food and others to serve as plates.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I cannot offer you young gentlemen
some fresh butter for your corn and potatoes,” said
Cal, as they sat down to supper, “but to be perfectly
candid with you, our cows seem to have deserted
us and we haven’t churned for several days
past. After all, the corn and potatoes will be very
palatable with a little salt sprinkled upon them, and
we have plenty of salt. Don’t hesitate to help
yourselves freely to it.”</p>

<p>“To my mind,” said Dick, “this is as good a
supper as I ever ate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s because of our sharp appetites,” answered
Larry. “We’re hungry enough to relish
anything.”</p>

<p>“Appetite helps, of course,” said Dick, thoughtfully;
“but so does contrast. An hour ago we
had all made up our minds to content ourselves for
many meals to come with the exclusive diet of fish
and game, which has been our lot for many meals
past. To find ourselves eating a supper like this
instead is like waking from a bad dream and finding
it only a nightmare.”</p>

<p>“It would be better still not to have the nightmare,”
answered Cal, speaking more seriously than
he usually did. “When you have a nightmare it
is usually your own fault, and pessimism is always
so. You fellows were pessimistic over the prospect
of a supper you could not enjoy. As you
have a supper that you can enjoy, the suffering you
inflicted upon yourselves was wholly needless.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” interposed Tom; “but we
couldn’t know that you were going to get all these
good things for us.”</p>

<p>“No, of course not. But if you hadn’t allowed
your pessimistic forebodings to make you unhappy,
you needn’t have been unhappy at all. If things
had turned out as you expected you’d have been
unhappy twice&mdash;once in lamenting your lot and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
once in suffering it. As it is, you’ve been needlessly
unhappy once and unexpectedly happy once,
instead of being happy all the while. I tell you
optimism is the only true philosophy.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is,” Dick admitted, “but it leads to
disappointment very often.”</p>

<p>“Of course. But in that case you suffer the ill,
whatever it is, only once; while the pessimist suffers
it both before it befalls and when it comes. That
involves a sheer waste of the power of endurance.”</p>

<p>Larry had forgotten to eat while his brother delivered
this little discourse, for he had never heard
Cal talk in so serious a fashion. Indeed, he had
come to think of his brother as a trifler who could
never be persuaded to seriousness.</p>

<p>“Where on earth did you get that thought, Cal?”
he asked, when Cal ceased to speak.</p>

<p>“It is perfectly sound, isn’t it?” was the boy’s
reply.</p>

<p>“I think it is. But where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“If it is sound, it doesn’t matter where I got it,
or how. But to satisfy your curiosity, I’ll tell you
that I thought it out down here in the woods when
I was a runaway. I was so often in trouble as to
what was going to happen, and it so often happened
that it didn’t happen after all, that I got to wondering
one day what was the use of worrying about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
things that might never happen. I was alone in
the woods, you know, and I had plenty of time to
think. So little by little I thought out the optimistic
philosophy and adopted it as the rule of my life.
Of course I could not formulate it then as I do now.
I didn’t know what the words ‘optimism’ and
‘pessimism’ meant, but my mind got a good grasp
upon the ideas underlying them. There! My sermon
is done. I have only to announce that there
will be no more preaching at this camp-meeting.
I’m going to take a look at your well, Tom, and if
the water is as good as you say, I’m going to empty
the rain water out of the kegs and refill them.
Rain water, you know, goes bad a good deal sooner
than other water&mdash;especially sand-filtered water.”</p>

<p>“I reckon Cal is right, Dick,” said Tom, when
their companion was out of earshot.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course he is, but did you ever stub your
toe? It’s a little bit hard to be optimistic on occasions
like that.”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s hardly what Cal meant&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course it isn’t. I was jesting.”</p>

<p class="pch">FOG BOUND</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys were not tired that evening, and after
their abundant supper they sat late talking and telling
stories and “just being happy,” Dick said.
The day had been a torrid one, but in the evening
there was a chill in the air which made a crackling
camp-fire welcome. When at last they grew sleepy
they simply rolled themselves in their blankets and
lay down upon the sand and under the stars. They
had built no shelter, as it was not their purpose to
remain where they were except for a single night.</p>

<p>It was not long after daylight when Tom, shivering,
sprang up, saying:</p>

<p>“I’m cold&mdash;hello! What’s this? Fog?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Larry, “a visitor from the gulf
stream. And it is almost thick enough to cut, too.
What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Do? Why, make the best of it and be happy,
of course,” answered Cal, piling wood upon the
embers to set the camp-fire going again. “The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
step in that direction is to get your blood circulating.
Stir around. Bring a bucket of water and
set the kettle to boil&mdash;that is to say, if you can open
a trail through this fog and find the water hole
without falling into it. Whew! but this is a marrow-searching
atmosphere.”</p>

<p>The fog was indeed so dense that nothing could
be seen at more than twenty paces away, while the
damp, penetrating chill set all teeth chattering and
kept them at it until rapid exercise set pulses going
again. Then came breakfast to “confirm the cure,”
Dick suggested, and the little company was comfortable
again. That is to say, all of them but
Larry. He was obviously uneasy in his mind, so
much so that he had little relish for his breakfast.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Larry,” asked Tom, presently;
“aren’t you warm yet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m warm enough, but there isn’t a
breath of air stirring, and this fog may last all day.
What do you think, Cal?”</p>

<p>“I think that very likely. I’ve seen fogs like
this that lasted two or three days.”</p>

<p>“How on earth are we to get to Beaufort while
it lasts?”</p>

<p>The question revealed the nature of Larry’s trouble.</p>

<p>“Why, of course we can’t do anything of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
kind,” Cal answered. “We should get lost in the
fog and go butting into mud banks and unexpected
shoals. No. Till this fog clears away we can’t
think of leaving the altogether agreeable shore
upon which a kindly fate has cast us. But we can
be happy while we stay, unless we make ourselves
unhappy by worrying. I know what is troubling
you, Larry, and it’s nonsense to worry about it. I
often think I wouldn’t carry your conscience about
with me for thirty cents a month.”</p>

<p>“But, Cal, you see it is our duty to notify the
revenue officers of our discovery before those smugglers
get away.”</p>

<p>“It may relieve your mind,” Cal answered in his
usual roundabout fashion, “to reflect that they can’t
get away. If they were still there when this fog
came in from the sea, they will stay there till it clears
away again. So we are really losing no time. In
addition to that consolation, you should take comfort
to yourself in the thought that even if the revenue
officers were in possession of the information
we have, they could do nothing till the fog lifts. So
far as I know, at least, they can see no farther
through fog than other people can, and shoals and
mud banks are unlikely to respect their authority
by keeping out of the way of such craft as they may
navigate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Cal put aside his playful manner of
speech, and became thoroughly earnest.</p>

<p>“Think a minute, Larry. We have absolutely no
official duty to do in this matter. We are doing our
best as good citizens to notify the authorities. At
present we can’t do it. There’s an end of that.
We have a pleasant bivouac here, with plenty of
food and more where it came from. Why
shouldn’t we make the best of things and be happy?
Why should you go brooding around, making the
rest of us miserable? I tell you it’s nonsense.
Cheer up, and give the rest of us a chance to enjoy
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Cal,” Larry answered; “and I
won’t spoil sport. I didn’t mean to, and my worrying
was foolish. By the way, what shall we do
to pass the time to-day?”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, we ought to put up a shelter.
A fog like this is very apt to end in soaking
rain, and if it does that to-night, we’ll sleep more
comfortably under a roof of palmete leaves than out
in the open. However, there’s no hurry about that,
and you can let Dick wallop you at chess for an
hour or so while Tom and I go foraging. You see
I’ve thought of a good many things that I ought to
have bought last night, but didn’t. Do you want
to go along, Tom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom did, and as they started away, Cal called
back:</p>

<p>“I say, Larry, suppose you put on a kettle of
rice to boil for dinner when the time comes. I
think I’ll bring back something to eat with it.”</p>

<p>Then walking on with Tom by his side, he fell
into his customary drawling, half-frivolous mode
of speech. Tom had expressed his pleasure in the
prospect of rice for dinner&mdash;rice cooked in the
Carolina way, a dish he had never tasted before
his present visit began.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Cal, “I was tenderly and affectionately
thinking of you when I suggested the
dish. And I had it in mind to make the occasion
memorable in another way. I remember very vividly
how greatly&mdash;I will not say greedily&mdash;you
enjoyed the combination of rice and broiled spring
chicken while we were in Charleston. I remember
that at first you seemed disposed to scorn the rice
under the mistaken impression that rice must always
be the pasty, mush-like mess that they made
of it at school. I remember how when I insisted
upon filling your plate with it you contemplated it
with surprise, and, contemplating, tasted the dainty
result of proper cooking. After that all was plain
sailing. I had only to place half a broiled chicken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
upon the rice foundation in your plate&mdash;half a
chicken at a time I mean&mdash;and observe the gustatory
delight with which you devoted yourself to
our favorite Carolina dish.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, your Carolina way of cooking it
makes rice good even when you have no chicken to
go with it. If the fog would thin itself down a
bit&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Which it won’t do in time for you to kill the
squirrels you were thinking of as a possible substitute
for chicken. Perish the thought. It is utterly
unworthy. You and I are out after spring
chickens, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Good! Do you think we can find any?”</p>

<p>“With the aid of the currency of our country
as an excitant of the negro imagination, we can.”</p>

<p>“You saw chickens at the negro quarters last
night, then?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not. But I observed a large pan on
a shelf in front of one of the cabins, and with more
curiosity than politeness I stood up on my tiptoes
and looked into it. Tom, that pan was more than
half full of chicken feed, and it was fresh at that.
Knowing the habits of persons of the colored persuasion,
I am entirely certain that no one of them
would have taken the trouble to prepare that chicken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
feed unless he was the happy possessor of chickens.
I’m going to call upon the dusky proprietor of that
pan this morning.”</p>

<p>“That’s another case of noticing, Cal, and another
proof of its value. We are likely to have
broiled spring chickens for dinner to-day just because
you observed that pan of chicken feed.
What else did you notice up there? I ask solely
out of curiosity.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t much else to observe. I saw
some fig bushes but they’ve been stripped. Otherwise
we should have had some figs for breakfast
this morning. Just now I observe that the fog is
manifesting a decided tendency to resolve itself into
rain, and if it does, that we must satisfy Larry’s
conscience by getting away from our present camp
this afternoon&mdash;or as soon as the fog is sufficiently
cleared away. So you and I must hurry on if
we’re to have those broiled chickens.”</p>

<p>As results proved, Cal was mistaken in his reckoning
of the time necessary to dissipate the fog.
It was merely taking the form of what is known
as a “Scotch mist,” which does not form itself into
rain drops and fall, but collects in drops upon whatever
it touches, saturating clothing even more
speedily than actual rain does and making all but
the sunniest dispositions uncomfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>But even a Scotch mist condition served to thin
the fog a little, though by no means enough to make
navigation possible. Larry watched conditions anxiously,
as Cal expected him to do, and his first
question when Cal and Tom returned with their
chickens revealed his state of mind.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it, Cal?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of what? If you refer to the moon, I am
satisfied in my own mind&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! You know what I mean. Do be serious
for once and tell me what you think of the prospect?”</p>

<p>“Conscience bothering you again?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We must get away from here to-day if
possible&mdash;and as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you give us time to have dinner and cook
some extra food for consumption when we get
hopelessly lost out there in the fog banks that are
still rolling in from the sea?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course we can’t leave here till the fog
clears away. But do you think it ever will clear
away?”</p>

<p>“It always has,” answered Cal, determined to
laugh his brother out of his brooding if he could
not reason him out of it. “In such experience as
I have had with fogs I never yet encountered one
that didn’t ultimately disappear, did you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what do you think of the prospect?” persisted
Larry.</p>

<p>“I can see so little of it through the fog,” Cal
provokingly replied, “that I am really unable to
form an intelligent opinion of it. What I do see
is that you haven’t begun to make our shelter yet.
In my opinion it would be well to do so, if only to
keep the chess board dry while a game is in progress.
Moreover, I have an interesting book or
two wrapped up in my oilskins, and if we are
doomed to remain here over night&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You don’t think then that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Frankly, Larry, I don’t know anything about
it. Neither do you, and neither does anybody else.
We’re in a very wet fog bank. We’ve got to stay
where we are till the weather changes. Don’t you
think our wisest course is to make ourselves as
comfortable and keep ourselves as cheerful as we
can while it lasts.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, but it’s pretty hard you know
to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not half as hard as chopping wood and
‘toting’ it in from the woods over there, and that
is what Tom and I are going to do after dinner
as our contribution to the general comfort. You’ll
find yourself feeling a great deal better if you
busy yourself making a really comfortable shelter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
while we’re at the other job. It may come on to
rain torrents this afternoon, and of course we won’t
leave here in the boat if it does.”</p>

<p>“That will do, Cal. I’m convinced, and I’m
a trifle ashamed of myself besides. I promise not
to worry any more. I decree that we shall not
leave port in a rain storm, and unless the weather
conditions become favorable before four o’clock
this afternoon we’ll not leave here any how until
to-morrow.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE OBLIGATION OF A GENTLEMAN</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fog held throughout the day, changing to
a deluge of rain about nightfall, but Cal and Tom
had provided an abundance of firewood, the palmete
shelter was waterproof, the long gray moss
with which it was carpeted was soft to loll upon,
and the book from which they read aloud by turns
proved to be an amusing one. Larry kept his
promise and indulged in no further impatience.</p>

<p>When morning came the rain was still coming
down in torrents, and it was unanimously agreed
that no attempt should be made to quit the place
until it should cease.</p>

<p>“An open rowboat in a heavy rain is about the
wettest place imaginable,” Dick said, and the experience
of the rest had been such as to confirm the
judgment.</p>

<p>When at last a brisk westerly wind began to tear
the clouds to pieces, all agreed that Larry’s patience
had fairly earned its reward, and all hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
worked hard to get as early a start as possible.
It was two o’clock in fact when they finally set
sail, with Cal again at the helm because he knew
of a narrow but navigable passage which would
enable them to avoid the heavy ebb tide of the
channel that Larry had selected two days before.
The tide would not begin to ebb for two or three
hours to come, and by taking this short cut Cal
hoped to reach broad waters before that time.</p>

<p>He did so in fact, but upon running out of the
little creek he was disappointed to find that a shift
had given him a headwind to contend with. There
was nothing for it but to beat to windward, and the
breeze was so light that their progress was slow.
Cal made the best of conditions as he found them,
according to his custom, but about sunset the tide
turned against him, and worse than that, the wind
went down with the sun, leaving not a breath to
fill the sails.</p>

<p>Then Cal asked for orders.</p>

<p>“What is your wish, Captain Larry?” he asked.
“Shall we take to the oars and push on against the
tide, or land for the night? Without a favoring
wind we can’t possibly make Beaufort to-night.”</p>

<p>“What do the rest of you say?” asked Larry,
in some perplexity.</p>

<p>“Never mind what anybody else says,” broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
in Cal, before the others could answer. “This
isn’t a debating club or an advisory council of ancients,
or anything else of the kind. We’re a ship’s
company and you are the captain; so give your
orders.”</p>

<p>“Very well, we’ll run ashore. Do you know of
a suitable place, Cal?”</p>

<p>“No, not from personal experience in these
parts, but I’ve been watching the coast-line over
there to starboard, and I think I make out the
mouth of a small creek or inlet. The chart doesn’t
show it very distinctly, but it roughly indicates a
number of small indentations in the land, and the
soundings given for all that shore seem satisfactory.”</p>

<p>“To the oars then,” said Larry, “and we’ll look
for a landing place somewhere over there. The
whole shore seems to be heavily wooded. Pull
away.”</p>

<p>It was fully dark when Cal’s keen eyes found
what he was looking for, namely, the sheltered
mouth of a small creek or inlet, heavily overshadowed
by woods and a tangled undergrowth.</p>

<p>Running into it the company landed on a small
bluff-like bit of shore and made things snug for
the night. The heavy dew, so prevalent on that
coast, was already dripping from the trees, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the air was very chill. To avoid the dew drippings
the camp-fire was built close to the margin of the
inlet at a point where a little patch of star-studded
sky showed clear overhead.</p>

<p>The little company sat with their backs against
a large fallen tree as they ate their supper and
planned an early start for the morrow. All were
eager to make the visit to Beaufort and have it over
with as soon as possible, for a reason which Dick
put into words:</p>

<p>“I’m anxious to go to Quasi. The very name
of the place appeals to my imagination; the story
of it fascinates me. How long will it take us to
get there, Cal, after we finish what we have to do
at Beaufort?”</p>

<p>“The wind bloweth where it listeth, you know,”
Cal answered; “and worse still, it doesn’t blow at
all unless it is doing a little ‘listing’; the tides are
subservient to the will of the sun and moon, and
we must reckon upon them as a frequently opposing
force; then too, there are fogs sometimes, as recent
experience has taught us, to say nothing of possible
encounters with smugglers, from which we may
not escape so easily next time as we did before.
How, then, shall I presume to set a time for our
arrival at Quasi, particularly when I do not know
how long we shall be detained at Beaufort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, not long,” broke in Larry. “We have
nothing to do there but report to the customs authorities
and spend an hour or so buying coffee,
ship biscuit, some hams&mdash;for we’re out of bacon&mdash;and
such other supplies of a non-perishable sort
as we need. Two hours ought to cover our stay
there.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not so certain of that,” said Cal.
“As likely as not our detention will last for two
days, or possibly two weeks, and if&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But how, Cal?” Tom interrupted with a look
almost of consternation on his face, for he, too,
was impatient to reach Quasi and try the hunting
there.</p>

<p>“Let Cal finish, Tom,” said Larry. “He has
something in mind.”</p>

<p>“Something on my mind,” Cal replied; “and
it weighs heavily too. I’ve been thinking of it
ever since we turned our prow toward Beaufort.”</p>

<p>“You must have thought it out by this time,
then; so go on and tell us about it,” said Dick, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I wonder the rest of you haven’t thought of it
for yourselves,” resumed Cal; “but it isn’t worth
while to speculate about that. I was going to say
that we four fellows have the misfortune to be
eye-witnesses in the case of those smugglers. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
saw them bring their goods ashore. Now I don’t
know what the revenue officers do with smugglers
when they catch them. I suppose they take them
to a United States Court somewhere, though where
I don’t know. Charleston is the most likely place
in the case of men caught along this coast. In
any case I suppose they need witnesses to testify
to the smuggling, and unfortunately we are the
witnesses in this case. Is it really necessary to
set the matter forth more fully? It all comes to
this, that we may be detained for an indefinite
length of time at Beaufort, or we may even be
taken back to Charleston as witnesses. For that
reason I am reluctant to go to Beaufort at all&mdash;at
least until we’ve had our trip out.”</p>

<p>“You’re quite right, Cal,” answered Dick; “it
would be a shame to have our jolly outing spoiled.
As for supplies, I suppose we might run down to
Bluffton and pick up the absolutely necessary
things&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, or we can do without them,” interposed
Tom, to whom every hour of their sporting trip
seemed a precious thing not to be lost on any account.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we could get them by going a little
out of our way,” said Cal, “or we could go without.
I spent two or three months alone down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
among these woods and waters without such things,
and I can’t remember that I was the worse for it&mdash;though
I confess my breeches and my shirt and
shoes suffered. Anyhow, Larry is our captain this
time, and he must decide. He hasn’t spoken a
word yet.”</p>

<p>“It has not seemed necessary,” Larry answered.
“Of course we shall go to Beaufort just as fast
as we can.”</p>

<p>“But why, Larry?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Simply because it is our duty.”</p>

<p>“But why can’t we wait till we’re on our way
back?”</p>

<p>“It would be too late then.”</p>

<p>“But I say, Larry,” interposed Dick, “do you
really think we are under so imperative an obligation
as that?”</p>

<p>“To do one’s duty is always an imperative obligation.
We are all of us the sons of gentlemen.
We have been trained to think&mdash;and truly so&mdash;that
a gentleman must do his duty regardless of
consequences to himself. So we are going to start
for Beaufort at daylight, no matter what annoyances
it may bring upon us.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are right,” said Dick and Tom
in a breath. Cal said nothing until one of them
asked him why he remained silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m a Rutledge,” he answered, “and what
Larry has said is the gospel in which I have been
bred. I hadn’t thought it out till Larry spoke,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Neither had I,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Tom. “Of course we’ve all been
bred in the same creed, and I for one shall never
again wait to be reminded of it when a duty presents
itself.”</p>

<p>“Your decision is unanimously sustained and approved,
Larry,” added Dick, by way of relaxing the
seriousness of the talk. “The Rutledges, the Garnetts
and the Wentworths echo your thought, if
not your words&mdash;for Echo insists upon pronouncing
them&mdash;‘Bully for you!’”</p>

<p>At that moment something happened which
brought all four of the boys to their feet and
prompted Cal to slip the cartridges out of his gun
and substitute others carrying buckshot in their
stead. The others, observing his act, quickly imitated
it.</p>

<p class="pch">FIGHT OR FAIR PLAY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the exchange of cartridges was in progress,
five men, all armed, approached the bivouac. They
had landed from a boat a hundred yards or so
further down the creek, and attempted to creep
upon the camp and take it by surprise.</p>

<p>Fortunately Larry’s quick ears had caught sound
of them, and by the time the exchange of bird for
buckshot was completed they were in plain view
and not more than a dozen or twenty yards away.</p>

<p>“Halt!” Larry cried out to them, and as they
seemed indisposed to obey the command, he called
again:</p>

<p>“Stand where you are or we’ll shoot!”</p>

<p>There was no doubt in Larry’s mind that these
men were a band of smugglers, or that they were
trying to spring upon his party unawares. He
had no mind to be taken by surprise by murderous
ruffians. Fortunately for all concerned, his command
was obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who are you and what do you want?”</p>

<p>“That we decline to say,” said the spokesman of
the party.</p>

<p>“Then stand off,” said Larry, “or go back to
your own place, wherever it is, or take the consequences.”</p>

<p>Larry was quick to observe that neither the
words nor the tone of the one who had spoken
were such as the drunken, degraded, ignorant men
he had seen in the smugglers’ camp would have
used, and the fact puzzled him. After a moment’s
reflection he called out:</p>

<p>“If you have any business with us you may
come ahead a few paces into the full light of the
fire and say what you have to say. But if one
of you raises a gun we’ll give you a volley of buckshot
straight at your breasts. Come on out of the
bushes and tell us what you want.”</p>

<p>As the advance was made and the full firelight
fell upon the five men, Larry saw that they were
in the uniform of the revenue cutter service, with
which he was familiar.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Boatswain,” he said, but
without relaxing his watchfulness; “I couldn’t see
your uniforms until now, and mistook your party
for one of a very different sort. Come to the fire
and tell us what you want; your men can stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
where they are till we understand each other better.”</p>

<p>This last was said because of an apparent purpose
on the part of the men to move forward in a
body.</p>

<p>“Now then, Boatswain, what have you to say
to us?” Larry asked, while the other three boys
stood watchfully by the huge trunk of the fallen
tree with their shotguns held precisely as they
would have been had their owners been alertly
waiting for a pointer to flush a flock of birds for
them to shoot on the wing.</p>

<p>“We are men in the revenue service,” the boatswain
answered. “We were sent ashore from the
cutter that lies just off the mouth of the creek to
ask who you are and what you are doing here&mdash;in
short, to give an account of yourselves. It will
save trouble if you answer us.”</p>

<p>“Coming from an agent of the revenue,” answered
Larry, with dignity, “your questions are
entirely proper. It was not necessary to couple an
implied threat with them. However, that was
nothing worse than a bit of ill manners, and I’ll
overlook it. To answer your questions: My
name is Lawrence Rutledge; one of the others is
my brother. We live in Charleston, and with our
two guests we are down here for a little sporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
trip. Is there anything else you’d like to know
about us?”</p>

<p>“That’s a queer sort of boat you’ve got,” answered
the other.</p>

<p>“I asked if there was anything else you wanted
to know,” said Larry, ignoring the comment on
the dory’s appearance as an impertinent one.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll have to talk with the lieutenant
about that. You see I’m only a warrant officer.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“On board the cutter.”</p>

<p>“Send for him then. We’ll give him any information
we can.”</p>

<p>“I think I see myself sending for him! I’ll
have to take you on board.”</p>

<p>“But we won’t go,” answered Larry, with eyes
snapping.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to go.”</p>

<p>“But we won’t. We are American citizens, attending
to our honest business. If your lieutenant
or any other officer of the Government wishes to
ask us any legitimate question, we’re ready to answer.
But we will not endure insult or wrong. If
you have a warrant for our arrest we’ll not resist,
but we’ll not submit to arrest without authority.”</p>

<p>“We don’t have to bother about warrants when
we’ve got smugglers dead to rights.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“But we are not smugglers.”</p>

<p>“That’s for you to settle with the lieutenant.
It’s my business to arrest all of you and take you
on board the cutter.”</p>

<p>In a low voice, before the boatswain had finished
his sentence, Larry said to his comrades:</p>

<p>“Jump over the log&mdash;we’ll make a breastwork
of it,” and instantly they obeyed, leaving him on
the side next the revenue men. Then to the boatswain
he said:</p>

<p>“You’ve no right to arrest without a warrant.
I tell you once for all we’ll not submit to arrest.”</p>

<p>“What’ll you do then?”</p>

<p>“We’ll fight first,” answered Larry, delivering
the words like shots from a pistol, and leaping to
the farther side of the fallen tree as he spoke.</p>

<p>The boatswain was bewildered. He knew, in
a vague way, that no one can legally make an arrest
without a warrant, except when he sees a person
in the act of committing crime or running
away from officers; but he had never before had an
experience of determined resistance. He was accustomed
to the summary ways of brute force that
prevail in military life, and to him it seemed absurd
for anybody to resist the only kind of constituted
authority with which he was familiar.</p>

<p>He was sorely perplexed. He was by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
sure that the boys were the smugglers he had been
sent to arrest. On the contrary, their manner,
their speech and all other appearances were in their
favor. Nevertheless his superior officers had been
watching the dory’s movements for several days
and had sent him ashore in full assurance that they
had their quarry at bay. He was convinced that
he ought to arrest the party, but he had only four
men and himself for the work, and there stood
four stalwart young fellows behind the fallen tree
trunk with four double-barreled shotguns bristling
across the barrier. The creek, with a sharp
bend, lay upon their left and completely covered
their rear, while on their right was a swamp so
densely grown up in cane and entangled vines, to
say nothing of the treacherous mud below, that
passage across it would have been nearly impossible
in the broadest light of day. Clearly Larry’s
party must be assailed in front if assailed at all,
and the boatswain was not to blame for hesitating
to make an assault which would almost certainly
cost the lives of himself and all his men. Add to
this his uncertainty as to his right to make any
assault at all, and what he did is easily understood.</p>

<p>He ordered his men to fall back to their boat,
and as they did so he stood alone where he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
been. When the men were well away, he said to
Larry:</p>

<p>“You don’t think me a coward, do you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” Larry answered.</p>

<p>“Well, this thing may get me into trouble you
know, and if you’re the man you say you are, I
may want you to help me out as a witness. Will
you do it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly. But what’s the use of getting
into trouble? I’m willing to trust your word as
an honorable fellow; if you’ll trust mine in the
same way you and I can settle this whole matter
in ten minutes in a way that will bring you praise
instead of blame. Don’t go aboard the cutter and
report a failure and be blamed for it; stay here
and talk the matter over and then go aboard with
a report that will do you honor. What do you
say to that?”</p>

<p>“What are your terms?”</p>

<p>“Only that you meet me in the same spirit in
which I meet you. Give up your notion that we
are a gang of smugglers&mdash;you must see how absurd
it is&mdash;and give up your claim of a right to
arrest us without a warrant; meet me half way and
I’ll show you how to get out of a scrape that you
wouldn’t have got into but for those two mistaken
guesses. We have no feeling of enmity toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
you and no wish to injure you. If we were ready
to fight you to the death, it was only in defense of
our rights. Give up your attempt to invade those
rights and there will be no quarrel between us. Is
it a bargain?”</p>

<p>“Well, you speak fair anyhow. I don’t see
what else I can do than meet you half way. I’m
ready.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Larry, emptying his gun
of its cartridges and signing to his comrades to
do likewise. “As you have sent your men away,
we’ll make things even by disarming ourselves.”</p>

<p>With instinctive recognition of the manly generosity
thus shown the boatswain tossed his own
gun to the ground and, advancing, held out his
hand, saying:</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have done that if you hadn’t
been what you say you are. I’m ready to sit down
now and talk things over.”</p>

<p>Larry sprang over the log that separated them
and took the proffered hand. Then all sat down,
and Larry said:</p>

<p>“I’m willing to tell you now what I never would
have told you under a threat. We have seen the
smugglers you are looking for; we know where
they are, or at any rate where they were two days
ago; we know where their plunder is hidden, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
we are prepared to go with you to the place. We
were on our way to Beaufort to report all this to
the revenue authorities when you came to arrest
us.”</p>

<p>The two had risen and were standing now, and
the boatswain was continually shaking Larry’s
hand. He tried to say what was in his mind but
couldn’t. His wits were bewildered for the moment,
and Larry came to their rescue.</p>

<p>“Pull yourself together, Boatswain,” he said,
“and listen to me. Hurry back to your boat, go
aboard the cutter at once, and report that you
haven’t found a smuggler’s camp but that you’ve
found somebody who can and will show your commanding
officer where one is. Tell him Lawrence
Rutledge and his companions offer their services as
guides who know where to go. Be off, quick.
We’ll wait here for his answer.”</p>

<p>The boatswain’s wits were all in his control now
and he hurried away. He had achieved victory
where only defeat had seemed possible. He had
met with success where a few minutes before he
had hoped for nothing better than failure. He
was going on board to receive commendation instead
of the censure he had expected. Honor was
his in lieu of dreaded disgrace.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XIX</h2>

<p class="pch">WHY LARRY WAS READY FOR BATTLE</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Larry</span>, you ought to be a major-general,” said
Dick, with enthusiasm, as soon as the boatswain was
well out of earshot. “I never saw anything better
managed than that was. From the moment
you put us behind the log, the fight&mdash;if there was
to be a fight&mdash;was all ours.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tom, “we’d have had no difficulty
in cleaning those fellows out if it had come to that,
and the boatswain saw it as clearly as we did. But
I don’t yet understand why you did it, Larry.”</p>

<p>“Why, simply to make sure of success in self-defense.
That seems simple enough,” responded
Larry.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that’s simple enough, but I wasn’t
thinking about that. I meant I don’t see why you
made any objection to going aboard at first and
telling the officers there all you’re going to tell
them now. You are going of your own accord
now; why didn’t you go when he wanted you to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because there was a principle at stake,” answered
Larry, setting his teeth together as he recalled
the controversy. “We are going aboard
now of our own accord, as you say. That’s very
different from going aboard as prisoners, under
compulsion.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see what difference it would have
made when you knew the officers there would make
guests instead of prisoners of us as soon as they
heard what you had to say. It seems to me it
would have come to the same thing in the end.”</p>

<p>“Not by a long shot,” answered Larry, speaking
with particular earnestness. “Think a minute,
Tom. We are free men, living under a free government
that exists for the express purpose of securing
liberty to all its people and protecting them
in the enjoyment of that liberty. If one man, or
one set of men, could arrest others without a warrant
from a court, there would be no security for
liberty and no liberty in fact. Whenever the people
of any country are ready to submit to any infringement
of their rights as free men, liberty in
that country is dead, and tyranny is free to work
its evil will. And in a free country it is the most
sacred duty of every man to resist the smallest as
well as the largest trespass upon his rights as a
man. Usually he can do this by appealing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
courts of law, but in a case like ours to-night,
where there is no possibility of making such an
appeal, every man must be ready to fight for his
rights&mdash;yes, to fight to the death for them if necessary.”</p>

<p>“But the matter was so small in this case&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What possible difference does that make? A
principle is never small; liberty is always of supreme
consequence, and it makes no difference how
trifling the trespass upon one’s liberty is in itself,
the duty to resist it at all costs and all hazards is
just the same. Convenience and comfort do not
count in any way. The difficulty is that men are
not always ready to take trouble and endure inconvenience
in defense of their rights where the
matter in question seems to them of small moment.
They forget that ‘eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty,’ or if they remember it, they are too self-indulgent
to undertake a troublesome resistance. It
was not so that the men of the Revolutionary time
looked at the matter. Webster said that the Americans
‘went to war against a preamble,’ and perhaps
they did, but the preamble involved a fundamental
principle. It was for the principle, not for the preamble,
that they fought for seven long years. The
colonists could easily have submitted to the impositions
of a half crazy king and his tyrannical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
prime minister. It would have saved them a vast
deal of inconvenience, expense and danger to do so.
It would have been far more comfortable for them
if they had done so. But if they had, this great,
free nation of ours would never have existed, and
the people in other civilized countries would not
have enjoyed anything like the liberty they do now.
In the same way it would have saved a lot of trouble
if we had let those people arrest us to-night,
but we had no right to submit to that. It was our
duty to stand upon our rights and defend the principle
by defending them.</p>

<p>“There! The lecture is over, and I promise not
to let it happen again,” said Larry, by way of indirect
apology for his seriousness.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tom, “I for one am glad I heard
the lecture as you call it. I needed it badly, for I
had never thought of these things in that way.
How did you come to have all that on the tip of
your tongue, Larry?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, or, yes I do. I was born and
brought up on that gospel, and I have heard it
preached all my life. My father has taught Cal
and me from childhood that ‘the only legitimate
function of government is to maintain the conditions
of liberty,’ and that the highest duty of every
citizen is to insist that the government under which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
he lives shall do precisely that. Now let’s talk of
something else, or you fellows talk, rather, for I’ve
talked more than my share already.”</p>

<p>“Before we do,” broke in Dick, “there’s just one
thing I’d like to ask.”</p>

<p>“All right. Go ahead. Ask anything you
please if it isn’t a conundrum.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t a conundrum. It is only that I
wonder how you know there isn’t some law authorizing
the revenue officers to make arrests without
warrants?”</p>

<p>“I know it simply because such a law is impossible.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Because there is no power on earth that can
make such a law for this country.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t Congress make it?”</p>

<p>“No. Congress has no more power to make it
than a flock of crows has.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand. If Congress should pass
an act to that effect and the President should sign
it, what then?”</p>

<p>“What then? Why just nothing at all. It
wouldn’t be a law. It would have no more force
or effect than the decree of a company of lunatics
that the sun shall hereafter rise in the west and set
in the east.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“But why not?”</p>

<p>“Why, simply because Congress has no power to
make any law that violates the Constitution. The
Constitution expressly secures certain rights to
every citizen. If Congress passes an act in violation
of the Constitution, or even an act that the
Constitution does not authorize it to pass, the courts
refuse to enforce it or in any way to recognize it
as a law. Now we’ve simply got to stop all this
discussion, for I hear the revenue officers coming.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">XX</h2>

<p class="pch">ABOARD THE CUTTER</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the boatswain made his report to the lieutenant
on board he did not confine himself to the
points Larry had suggested. It had been his first
thought to do so, reporting only that he had found
no smugglers but had discovered a law-abiding company
of youths who knew where the smugglers were
and were willing to act as guides to the point indicated.</p>

<p>But on his way it occurred to him that the lieutenant
might ask him questions&mdash;how he knew the
character of the boys, and why he had not placed
them under arrest, and other things relating to the
conduct of his expedition.</p>

<p>It would be humiliating to have the story thus
drawn out of him, and it would be awkward for
him to explain why he had not reported the whole
thing in the first place. So, upon reflection, he told
the story in full, though briefly.</p>

<p>When he mentioned Larry’s name the lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
gave a little start and leaning forward as if to make
sure he heard aright, asked:</p>

<p>“What did you say his name is?”</p>

<p>“Lawrence Rutledge is the name he gave me,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Of Charleston?”</p>

<p>“That’s where he said he lived, sir,” answered
the boatswain, wondering why his superior was so
closely questioning him on these points.</p>

<p>The lieutenant resumed his upright position and
with a half laugh said:</p>

<p>“It’s lucky for you that you chose discretion as
the better part of valor this time. If Lawrence
Rutledge is any way akin to his father, you’d have
had the tidiest little fight you ever heard of on your
hands if you’d charged him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there would have been any fight
at all, sir, if you’ll pardon me.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Only that I think every man of us would have
bitten dust before we could have fired a gun. Those
fellows were ready with guns cocked and leveled.”</p>

<p>“The moral of that is that you too should always
be ready and have your men ready. Order
the gig alongside&mdash;men unarmed.”</p>

<p>When the gig was ready, which was almost instantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the lieutenant ran down the ladder, dropped
into her, took the helm, and gave the orders:</p>

<p>“Oars!” “Let fall!” “Give way!” and the
boat shot away toward the plainly visible camp-fire.</p>

<p>Landing, he introduced himself to Larry, who
received him cordially and in turn presented his
comrades.</p>

<p>“I have the pleasure of knowing your father
very well, Mr. Rutledge,” he began.</p>

<p>“Then, please,” Larry interrupted, “call me
‘Lawrence,’ or ‘Larry,’ and not ‘Mr. Rutledge,’
Lieutenant. I’m only a boy yet, and I’ll never be
‘Mister’ to any of my father’s friends.”</p>

<p>“Very well. ‘Larry’ it shall be then, the more
gladly because that is what I called you years ago
when, as I remember, I was telling a lot of sea
stories to you and your brother Calhoun&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Make it Cal, Lieutenant,” said the youth mentioned.
“Larry and I are twins, you know, and always
share things evenly between us. We did so
with your stories, you know. I remember it very
well, though we were a pair of very small youngsters
then.”</p>

<p>“So you were&mdash;so young that I didn’t think
you would remember the matter. But we’re losing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
time, and time may be precious in this case. My
petty officer tells me you young gentlemen have
seen the miscreants I’ve been hunting for and can
tell me where they are.”</p>

<p>“We’ve seen them, and our friend Tom Garnett
here has been inside one of their caches and inspected
their goods. We can tell you where they
were two nights or so ago, and perhaps they are
there yet.”</p>

<p>“Almost certainly they are,” broke in the lieutenant.
“It is calm weather outside, and not a
craft of any kind has put in here under plea of
weather stress since the <i>Senorita</i> sailed two or three
days ago.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Senorita</i>?” Tom repeated; “why, that’s
the ship’s name I saw marked on some of the cigar
cases and rum kegs they had.”</p>

<p>“Good, good, good!” said the officer enthusiastically.
“If we can get to that hiding place before
they remove the goods, I’ll telegraph to Baltimore
to nab the ship also when she comes in. We
<i>must</i> get there in time. My officer understood that
you and your party were willing to go with us.
Was his understanding correct?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Larry answered, “we’ll be glad to do
that, but we must make some provision for the
safety of our boat while we are gone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’ll be safe enough when she rests on the cutter’s
deck. I’ll send a crew to take her alongside
and we’ll hoist her on board. When all’s over I’ll
put you in the water again at any point you choose.
Is that satisfactory?”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” answered Larry. “We’re
ready, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Come on then, and I’ll take you aboard. I’ll
leave a man with your craft till a boat’s crew can
come and tow her alongside. Then we’ll weigh anchor
and be off.”</p>

<p>It was less than fifteen minutes later when the
boys saw the <i>Hunkydory</i> carefully braced upon the
little steamer’s deck and closely covered with a tarpaulin.</p>

<p>But it was nearly midnight and the lieutenant invited
the boys to sleep in the comfortable berths
provided for them until the cutter should reach the
neighborhood of the smugglers’ camp. He thought
he sufficiently recognized the locality from Cal’s description,
and probably he could have steamed to it
without further guidance. But there was no sleep
in the eyes of the boys after their adventurous night,
and they all heartily echoed Cal’s sentiment when
he answered:</p>

<p>“What good is there in the frazzled end of a
ragged night for sleeping purposes. I for one will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
stay up till we see this thing through, if it is going
through to-night.”</p>

<p>The little cutter was a fleet-winged craft, built
for speed, and carrying greatly more horse power
than ordinary steamers of twice her size. Her navigator
and all her officers, indeed, knew every detail
of the waters they were traversing, and so the
lieutenant hoped that he might reach his destination
in time to descend upon the smugglers before morning.</p>

<p>In this he was disappointed. Some accident to
the cutter’s machinery compelled a delay of two or
three hours in a narrow strait where, to add to the
annoyance of delay, a swarm of sand flies descended
upon the ship’s company. These are minute insects,
so minute that no screen or netting, however
finely woven, interferes in the least with their free
passage in or out of any opening. Their bite or
sting is even more painful than that of a mosquito,
and they come in myriads.</p>

<p>Under the advice of the commanding officer the
boys retreated to a closed cabin below and remained
there until the ship was under way again&mdash;otherwise
for two or three hours, during which they
lolled about and managed to get some sleep in spite
of their impatience over the delay and the otherwise
excited condition of their minds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>By way of making themselves more comfortable,
they all drew off their boots, but they could not be
persuaded to go to the bunks assigned to their use,
because the ship might start again at any moment
and they were determined to be ready for that whenever
it should occur.</p>

<p>Cal, as usual, was the most wakeful of the party,
and at first he was disposed to talk, but his impulse
in that way was promptly checked when Tom and
Larry each threw a boot at him and Dick, half
asleep, muttered:</p>

<p>“I second the motion.”</p>

<p>As a consequence of this drastic treatment Cal
closed his lips and his eyes at the same moment and
was presently breathing as only a sleeper does.
The others, tired and worn out with an excitement
that had by this time passed away, were soon in a
profound slumber which lasted until the engines
began to throb again and the ship to jar and tremble
with the rapid revolutions of the screw.</p>

<p>The sun was well up by that time, and after going
on deck, where a sailor doused bucketfuls of salt
water over them as an eye-opener, they were invited
to breakfast with the commanding officer.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXI</h2>

<p class="pch">TOM’S SCOUTING SCHEME</p>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> breakfast the talk was, of course, about
the smugglers and the chances of capturing them.
In the course of it the lieutenant manifested some
confusion or uncertainty of mind as to the exact position
of the smugglers’ rendezvous and of the approaches
to it.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please clear that up a little for me?”
he asked Larry, after a vain attempt to clear it up
for himself. “I don’t quite understand. Perhaps
you can make it plain to my dullness.”</p>

<p>“Cal can do that better than any other member
of our party,” Larry answered. “He was all about
there three or four years ago, while the rest of us
have been there only once. Besides, Cal has a nose
for geographical detail, and he observes everything
and remembers it. Explain the thing, Cal.”</p>

<p>“After such an introduction,” Cal replied, smiling,
“I fear I shall not be able to live up to the
character so generously attributed to me. Still, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
think I can explain the thing; it is simple enough.
May I have paper and a pencil?”</p>

<p>These were promptly furnished, and Cal made a
hasty diagram.</p>

<p>“You see, Lieutenant, there is a little creek or
estuary here. It is very narrow, especially at the
mouth, and it runs inland for only a few miles. I
can’t find it on the chart. Probably it is too insignificant
to be noted there. You observe that it runs
in a tortuous course, ‘slantwise’ to the shore, and
keeping always within a comparatively short distance
of the broad water, thus forming a sort of
tongue of land.</p>

<p>“A little further along the shore of the broader
water is another little estuary or cove, only a few
hundred yards in its total length, but that length
extends toward the creek on the other side, so that
only about half a mile or less of swamp and thicket
separates the two.</p>

<p>“Right there, about midway between the two,
those thieves have their den. They can approach
it in their boats from either side, coming up the
creek or entering the cove, and in either case landing
within less than a quarter of a mile of their thicket-hidden
rendezvous. As both the creek and the
smaller estuary make a sharp bend near their
mouths, a boat slipping into either of them is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
once lost to view. I wonder if I have made the
geography clear?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly so, and I thank you. Our plan will
be to send boats up both the little waterways at
once. Can we find their mouths, think you?”</p>

<p>“I can, and Tom knows both of them. He and
I will be your pilots.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. But you know you may get shot
in the mêlée and you are under no sort of obligation
to take that risk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we want to see the fun,” said Tom. “We’ll
be with you, you may depend.”</p>

<p>“Is it your plan,” Larry asked after dinner that
day, “to attack by daylight?”</p>

<p>“I think we must make the descent as promptly
as possible. So I intend to make it to-day, as soon
as we get to that neighborhood.”</p>

<p>Larry made no reply and the officer observed the
fact.</p>

<p>“What is it you have on your mind, Larry?”
he asked. “Have you any suggestion to offer?”</p>

<p>“No, I would not presume to do that. I was
only thinking that in a daylight descent you might
miss the game.”</p>

<p>“Go on, please. Tell me all you had in mind.”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, those rascals have a lookout
tree from which they can see for miles in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
direction. We used it for purposes of observation
when we were there. It is true that they seem to
visit it very seldom, but they might happen to climb
it just in time to see this cutter hovering around.
In that case they would probably go into hiding
somewhere. If not, they would at least keep a
sharp lookout for your boats. If you kept entirely
away from there until night you would probably
take them by surprise. But of course you know
best.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that. What you suggest is
a matter to be considered. But I’m afraid to wait
until night lest in the meantime the rascals leave the
place.”</p>

<p>“That is possible,” said Cal, joining in the conversation
for the first time, “but it seems to me
exceedingly unlikely.”</p>

<p>“Why so, Cal?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve pretty closely observed those gentry,
and they seem to me of that variety that does
most of its comings and goings under cover of darkness.
If they were in their camp this morning they
are pretty sure to remain there until to-night.
There is another point that Larry didn’t suggest.
If you attack the camp in daylight the ruffians can
easily save themselves by scattering and making
their escape through the well-nigh impenetrable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
swamp. They would have the advantage over your
men in that, as of course they know every little
blind trail and could avoid tangles in which your
men would become hopelessly involved.”</p>

<p>“But wouldn’t they be at still greater advantage
in a night attack?”</p>

<p>“I think not. They will probably get blind drunk
by night, for one thing. They’re apt to sleep profoundly.
We can land without being seen, and
once ashore, we can creep clear up to their lair without
alarming them. Then we’ll be on them with
our boot heels as it were.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think they won’t be on the alert at
night, with pickets out and all that?”</p>

<p>“Because we’ve experimented,” answered Cal.
“We’ve crept up to the very edge of their camp
and watched them there by the hour. Tom here
even entered one of the hovels where they bestow
the smuggled goods.”</p>

<p>The officer was much impressed with these suggestions.
He meditated for a while, and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>“If I could only know whether they are still
there or not! I’d give ten dollars to know that!”</p>

<p>“You can get the job done for less, Lieutenant,”
said Tom, who was always eager for perilous adventure
and almost insanely reckless in his pursuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of it. “If you’ll bring the cutter to anchor somewhere
around here and let me go ashore, I’ll find
out all about it and not charge you a cent either.”</p>

<p>“What’s your plan?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t much of a plan. It is only to go to the
smugglers’ den, see if they are there, and then come
back and tell you.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s easy enough. The smugglers can’t see
the cutter so long as she’s in this bay, even if they
climb to the top of their lookout tree. I’m sure of
that, because I’ve tried to see the bay from there
and couldn’t, although I knew just where it lay.”</p>

<p>At this point the lieutenant interrupted:</p>

<p>“Pardon me a moment. I’ll bring her to anchor.”</p>

<p>Before he returned to the company a minute or
so later, the engines stopped, and as he sat down the
boys heard the chains rattle as the anchor was cast
overboard.</p>

<p>“Now go ahead, please, and tell me all about your
plan,” the officer said with eager interest.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t more than three or four miles,
I should say, from this point to the mouth of our
creek, and the tide is with me all the way. If you’ll
set our dory in the water and Cal will go with me
to help row&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll all four go, of course,” said Larry.</p>

<p>“In that case, we can put ourselves back at our
old camp in about an hour with such a tide as this
to help us. When we land there I’ll go at once to
the lookout tree, climb to the very top of it and see
what is going on. Then, if there’s anything more
to be found out, I’ll creep down to the neighborhood
of the rascals’ place and take a closer look. When
the dory gets back here I can tell you all you want
to know.”</p>

<p>“Excellent!” exclaimed the officer. “Only, instead
of having you boys row the dory all that
way, I’ll have you taken to the place you want to
reach in a ship’s boat.”</p>

<p>“They might see that,” objected Tom, “and
take the alarm, while if they see the dory returning
to her old anchorage they’ll think nothing about it.
Besides, we don’t mind a little rowing. The tide’s
with us going, and if necessary, we can stay up
there in the creek till it turns and is ready to help
us come back.”</p>

<p>“There won’t be any waiting,” said Cal. “It’ll
turn just about the time we get there&mdash;or even before
that if we don’t get away from here pretty
quick.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the lieutenant. “The plan is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
yours, Tom, and you shall have your own way in
carrying it out.”</p>

<p>A hurried order from the commanding officer, a
little well-directed scurrying on the part of the seamen,
and the <i>Hunkydory</i> lay alongside, ready for
her crew to drop from a rope ladder into her.</p>

<p>They nimbly did so, and as they bent to their
oars they passed around a point and out of sight of
the cutter.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXII</h2>

<p class="pch">TOM DISCOVERS THINGS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> advice of the lieutenant, the boys left their
shotguns on board the cutter and carried instead
the short, hard-shooting repeating rifles that he furnished
them. Armed in this way, each could fire
many shots in rapid succession, instead of the two
which alone their shotguns permitted.</p>

<p>“We can defend ourselves now if the gang discovers
and assails us,” said Larry, with a satisfied
smile. “With these guns we’re a good deal more
than a match for those ten smugglers armed as they
are with nothing better than pistols. By the way,
Tom, what’s the plan of campaign?”</p>

<p>“That’s for you to say,” Tom answered.
“You’re the captain.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it this time,” responded Larry.
“This is <i>your</i> expedition and you must manage it
in your own way.”</p>

<p>“That’s only fair,” said Dick. “Tom has undertaken
to go ashore, find out certain facts and report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
them. We’re here to help him in any way he
wishes, but he is responsible for results and must
choose his own methods.”</p>

<p>“I congratulate you, Dick, on having another
lucid interval,” broke in Cal, who could never endure
seriousness for long. “‘Pon my word, they’re
growing more and more frequent and by the time
we get back to Charleston we’ll have to discharge
you as ‘cured.’”</p>

<p>“Stop your nonsense, Cal,” said Larry, “and let
Tom give us our instructions.”</p>

<p>“Fortunately, I’m under no sort of obligation
to stop my nonsense at your command, Larry, as
by your own voluntary declaration you’re not captain
of this special trip ashore, and Tom is.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Tom, laughing. “I’ll give the
order myself. Stop your nonsense till I get through
mine&mdash;for I dare say you’ll all think my plan is
nonsensical.”</p>

<p>“All right as to that,” said Larry, “but what is
your plan? It doesn’t matter what we think of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, my notion is not to pull the <i>Hunkydory</i>
up on shore, but to anchor her at our old landing,
so that we can handle her quickly in case of
need. Two of you are to stay by her&mdash;that will
be you and Dick, Larry. If we should be discovered,
and those rascals should want to catch us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
their first effort would be to get possession of our
boat and put us into a trap. So you two will stay
with the dory, and if you are in trouble, Cal and I
will come to your assistance as fast as our legs can
carry us. Cal will go with me to the lookout tree
and stay there while I creep down to the lair of the
thieves. If I get into trouble he’ll know it and signal
you by firing one shot. Then, of course, you’ll
all come to my support. How does that strike you
as a plan, Larry?”</p>

<p>“A Lee or a Grant couldn’t make a better one.
Here we are at the mouth of the creek.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it ridiculous?” asked Cal, as they turned
into the inlet.</p>

<p>“Isn’t what ridiculous&mdash;the creek, or its mouth,
or what?” Tom responded.</p>

<p>“Why, the way things keep turning themselves
around. First, the gentleman with the impaired
walking apparatus, representing the smugglers, mistook
us for officers or agents of the revenue, and
sought to make prisoners of us by getting possession
of our boat, so that we had to disarm him in self-defense.
Next, the officers of the revenue mistook
us for the smugglers and we had to defend ourselves
against them. Now we are helping our later assailants
to capture our foes of an earlier date. Wonder
if we shall presently have to join the smugglers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and assist them against the revenue people?”</p>

<p>“That last question answers itself, Cal,” said
Tom; “and if it didn’t, there’s no time to discuss
it now, for here we are at the landing. Run her
head to the shore, fellows, and let Cal and me jump
out. Then back her out a little way and anchor
her. I leave you in charge of the ship in my absence,
Lieutenant Larry. You have your instructions;
see that you obey them to the letter.”</p>

<p>With footsteps quickened by eager interest, Tom
and Cal were not long in making the journey to the
lookout tree. Tom climbed it to the top and very
carefully studied what lay before him. Cal, who
was watching him, observed that he seemed specially
interested by something over to the left where
the creek lay, and perhaps a little puzzled by it.
But he asked no questions as Tom hurried from
the tree-top and set off down the blind trail.</p>

<p>He was gone for so long a time&mdash;nearly two
hours&mdash;that Cal became very uneasy about him,
but at last he came out of the thicket and set off
toward the dory’s anchorage at as rapid a trot as
the nature of the ground would permit. He said
nothing to Cal except the three words: “We must
hurry,” and as he neared the landing, he called out:</p>

<p>“Up anchor, quick.”</p>

<p>Then as the boat was moved toward the shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
he impatiently waded out to meet her in water leg-length
deep. Cal followed, though he did not know
the cause of Tom’s hurry.</p>

<p>“Are they after us?” asked Larry and Dick,
both speaking at once.</p>

<p>“No. But we must hurry or it’ll be too late.”</p>

<p>In response Larry shipped his oars as the mouth
of the creek was passed and, with Dick’s assistance,
stepped the mast, hoisted sail and let the sheet run
out until the boom was almost at right angles with
the keel.</p>

<p>“There’s a stiff wind,” he said by way of explanation,
“and it’s almost exactly astern. We can
make better time with the sails. Here, Dick, you’re
the best sailor; take the helm and get all you can
out of the breeze.”</p>

<p>“Don’t hug the port rail so close,” Dick ordered;
“trim toward the kelson and let her heel over to
starboard; there, that will do; she makes her best
running with the rail awash.”</p>

<p>As they sped on, nobody asked Tom what the occasion
for his hurry was. He seemed still out of
breath for one thing, and for another the rush of
the dory’s rail through the water made it difficult
to hear words spoken in an ordinary tone, for
though the wind was steadily freshening, Dick refused
to spill even a capful of it. He was sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
now for speed, and he wanted to get all he could
out of the wind. But chief among the reasons for
not asking questions was the instinctive courtesy
of Tom’s comrades. They realized that he had
discovered something of importance, and they felt
that he ought to have the pleasure of himself reporting
it to the commanding officer of the cutter
before telling anybody else about it.</p>

<p>In the same spirit, when the dory was laid along
the cutter’s side, they held back to let Tom be the
first to climb to the deck, where the lieutenant was
awaiting him.</p>

<p>Tom’s excitement was gone, now that he had accomplished
his purpose of reaching the cutter before
dark&mdash;a thing he had feared he might not do.
His report was made calmly, therefore, and with
smiles rippling over his face&mdash;smiles of rejoicing
over his success, and other smiles, prompted by
recollections of what seemed to him the humorous
aspects of what he had seen and done.</p>

<p>The report was utterly informal, of course; Tom
was not used to military methods.</p>

<p>“They are all there, Lieutenant,” he began, “but
they won’t be there long after it grows dark.
They’re preparing to leave to-night, as early as they
can get the drunken ones among them sober enough
to sit on a thwart and hold an oar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you know that, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Why, I heard the boss brute say so while he
was rousing one of the drunkest of them into semi-consciousness
by kicking him in the ribs with force
enough to break the whole basket I should think.
I won’t repeat his language&mdash;it wasn’t fit for publication&mdash;but
the substance of it was that the victim
of his boot blows had ‘got to git a move onto him’
because ‘them boats has got to git away from here
jest as soon as it’s good and dark.’”</p>

<p>“Why, were you near enough to hear?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I wasn’t more than ten paces away
from the pair at the time that interesting conversation
occurred.”</p>

<p>“Tell us all about it, Tom&mdash;the whole story.
There’s plenty of time. It won’t be ‘good and
dark,’ as criminals reckon such things, for nearly
two hours yet. Begin at the beginning.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any story in it,” said Tom, “but
I’ll tell you what I did. When I climbed to the top
of the lookout tree, I saw first of all that our game
was still there. But I noticed that some of them&mdash;all
that weren’t drunk, I suppose&mdash;were busy. I
couldn’t make out at that distance what they were
doing, but I thought they seemed to be carrying
things, not down to the cove where we saw them
land the other night, but over toward our creek, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
we call it. I tried to see their landing place there,
but couldn’t.</p>

<p>“Of course I had already found out all you
wanted to know, but I wanted to know something
more. My curiosity was aroused, and I determined
to gratify it. So, sliding down, I made my way to
my old hiding place in the thicket near their camp.
Then I saw what they were at. They were taking
the cigars and rum out of the little hovels they use
as caches, and carrying them over to their landing
on the creek. I wondered why, but I could not see
the landing, so I had to let that remain as an ‘unexplored
region,’ for the time being at least.</p>

<p>“Presently the gentleman of the impaired locomotor
attachments made a final visit to the hut that
stood nearest me&mdash;the one I had myself entered
on a previous occasion. As he came out and passed
the boss bully, he said:</p>

<p>“‘That’s all they is in there.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I’ll look and see for myself,’ said the
boss, seeming to doubt the veracity of his follower.
He went into the hut and presently came out, muttering:</p>

<p>“‘Well, he told the truth for once&mdash;I didn’t
’spose he knew how.’</p>

<p>“As he walked away from the empty hovel it
occurred to me that I might find it a safer point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of observation than the one I had. So I slipped
into it, and dug out one of the chinks in the log
wall, to make a peep hole. It was then that I saw
the boss making a football of his follower and heard
him say what he did about getting the boats away.</p>

<p>“That still further stimulated my curiosity. I
wanted to see how nearly the boats were loaded,
and the sort of landing place they had, and all the
rest of it. So I determined to go over that way.
It was slow work, of course. The undergrowth
was terribly tangled, and then the smugglers were
passing back and forth with their loads. As their
path was often very near me, I had to stop and lie
down whenever I saw any of them approaching.</p>

<p>“I got down there at last and saw the boats.
They were partly loaded, but most of the freight
was still on the bank. I suppose that was because
they wanted to get all the things there before bestowing
them. All the rum kegs that had been
brought down were in the boats, while all the cigars
were piled on the banks.</p>

<p>“I noticed one thing that puzzled me; instead of
anchoring the boats and loading them afloat, they
had pulled them up on shore. As the tide had begun
to ebb, I wondered how they were to get them
into the water again after putting their cargoes
aboard. However, that was their business and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
mine. I had seen all there was to see, so I slowly
crept back again till I reached the trail. Then I
hurried for fear the quarry would escape before we
could get there with your boats.</p>

<p>“That’s all there is to tell.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant smiled his satisfaction as he commended
Tom’s exploit, adding:</p>

<p>“We can let it ‘get good and dark’ before
pouncing upon them. They won’t get away in a
hurry. They’ll have trouble getting their boats
afloat again. Indeed, they’ll probably wait for the
next flood tide. Anyhow, we won’t leave here till
it is thoroughly dark. You’re sure you can find
your way into the creeks in the dark? It’s cloudy,
and the night promises to be very black.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’ll be no trouble about that,” answered
Cal.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">TOM AND THE MAN WITH THE GAME LEG</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was very dark indeed when the ship’s boats,
well manned and with carefully muffled oars, set
out for the capture.</p>

<p>Tom was at the bow of one of them and Cal at
that of the other, to act as pilots. It was planned
that these two boats should lead the way into the
two entrances, the others closely following.</p>

<p>Silently the two fleets made their way to the
two points of landing. The one which passed up
the creek halted as soon as it came within sight of
the landing where the smugglers were busily and
noisily trying to get their loaded boats afloat, a task
in which they were encountering much difficulty, as
the lieutenant had foreseen that they must. It was
the lieutenant’s plan that his boats should lie there,
hidden by the darkness, until the men entering by
the cove should land, march across the neck of
swamp, and take the smugglers in the rear, thus cutting
off all possibility of their escape into the bushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as he saw the signal light that Tom
showed to announce the readiness of the party he
accompanied, the lieutenant rushed his boats ashore,
and the two revenue parties, without firing a shot,
seized and disarmed their foes, who, until their captors
were actually upon them, had had no dream of
their coming.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, under the lieutenant’s previously
given orders, the cutter had slowly steamed
up toward the mouth of the creek, where, at a signal,
she came to anchor.</p>

<p>Hurriedly the captured booty was loaded into
the ship’s boats and carried to the revenue vessel.
Then the smugglers’ camp was minutely searched
to see if any goods remained there, and the hovels
were set on fire.</p>

<p>While all this was going on that curiosity on
Tom’s part, which had done so much already, was
again at work. Tom wanted to know something
that was not yet clear to him, and he set to work to
find out. Detaching the lame smuggler from his
companions, Tom entered into conversation with
him. Fortunately the man was sober now, and had
been so long enough to render him despondent.</p>

<p>“You’re not fit for this sort of thing,” Tom said
to him after he had broken through the man’s
moody surliness and silence. “With your game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
leg and the brutal way the others treat you, I should
think you’d have got out of it long ago.”</p>

<p>“They’d ’a’ killed me if I’d tried,” the man answered.</p>

<p>“Well, they can’t do that now,” said Tom, “for
they’re in for a term in prison.”</p>

<p>“But they’s others, jest as I told you that night
you fellers caught me at your boat. There’s the
fellers up the creek what’s a-waitin’ this minute for
us to come up with the goods.”</p>

<p>This was what Tom wanted to find out.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” he replied; “they’ll be disappointed,
won’t they? I suppose they expect to get
the goods well inland before morning?”</p>

<p>“No, not exactly; but they’d ’a’ got ’em hid into
a little store they’ve got up there, so’s they could
work ’em off up to Charleston or down to Savannah,
little at a time, like. Howsomever, the game’s
up now, and them what’s got all the profits out’n it’ll
play pious an’ go scot free, while us fellers what’s
done all the work an’ took all the risks has got to
go to jail.”</p>

<p>A new thought suddenly struck Tom.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> needn’t, if I’m not mistaken. Anyhow,
there’s a chance for you that’s worth working for.”</p>

<p>“What’s the good o’ talkin’ that away? Ain’t
I ketched long o’ the rest?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, of course. I was only thinking&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What was you a-thinkin’?”</p>

<p>“Oh, only that the revenue people would a good
deal rather have the ‘others’ you speak of&mdash;the
men further up the creek and the men behind them&mdash;than
to have you.”</p>

<p>“I reckon they would, but what’s that got to do
with it?”</p>

<p>“Only that if you made up your mind to turn
Government’s witness and give the whole snap
away; they’d be pretty apt to let you off easily.”</p>

<p>The man sat silent for a time. At last he muttered:</p>

<p>“First place, I don’t know enough. Them fellers
ain’t no fools an’ they ain’t a-lettin’ fellers like
me into their secrets. I ain’t never seed any of ’em,
‘ceptin’ the storekeeper up that away what takes
the stuff from us, an’ pays us little enough for gittin’
it there. ’Sides that, them fellers has got money
an’ lots o’ sense. Even ef I know’d all about it an’
ef I give it away, ’twould be only the wuss for me.
They’d have me follered to the furdest corner o’
the earth an’ killed like a dog at last. No, ’tain’t
no use. I’ve got to take my medicine. Time for
runnin’ away is past, an’ I ain’t got but one good
leg to run with, you see.”</p>

<p>“What made you lame, anyhow?” asked Tom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
by way of keeping up the conversation without
seeming too insistent on his suggestion that the man
should confess.</p>

<p>“That bully with the red face&mdash;our captain, as
he calls hisself. He kicked my hip out’n jint one
day when I was drunk, an’ seein’s they wa’nt no
doctor anywheres about, he sot it hisself, an’ sot it
wrong somehow. Anyhow, I’d like to do him up
if I could.”</p>

<p>Tom noted the remark and the vindictive tone in
which it was made, but he did not reply to it at
once. Instead, he said:</p>

<p>“They must pay him better than they do the rest
of you?”</p>

<p>“Him? You bet! He gits a lot out’n the business,
an’ he’s got dead oodles and scads o’ money
put away in the bank. He’s close in with the big
ones what’s backin’ the game. It was him what set
it up fust off&mdash;leastways him an’ Pedro Mendez.”</p>

<p>“Who is Pedro Mendez?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s&mdash;never you mind who he is. See
here, young feller, you’s a axin’ too many questions.”</p>

<p>“Not too many for your good if you have
sense enough to take my advice. Listen to me!
You know a great deal more about this lawless
business than you pretend. You know enough to
make you a very valuable witness. If you choose
to help the revenue people in getting at the bottom
of it and breaking it up, they’re sure to let you off
very easily, and as for killing you, the people in the
thing will have enough to do in looking out for
themselves without bothering about that after they
get out of jail.”</p>

<p>Tom explained and elaborated this point, and at
last the lame man began to see hope ahead for himself.</p>

<p>“Will they make a certain sure promise to let
me off if I tell all I know?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No. They can’t do that, for if they did your
testimony would be worthless. But they always
do let state’s witnesses off easily, and in such a case
as this they’re sure to do so. You can be very easy
about that.”</p>

<p>“An’ they’d bear down all the harder on the
cap’n when they found out he was one o’ the big
managers o’ the game, wouldn’t they?”</p>

<p>“I should say they would give him the largest
dose the law allows.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it then, jest to git even with him. I’ll
do it even if they don’t reckon it up much to my
credit. How’ll I go about it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll arrange that for you. I’ll tell the lieutenant
who is in command here that you’re ready to ‘give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the snap away,’ and he’ll take your statement.
Then, when the time comes you’ll only have to go
into court and tell your story over again.”</p>

<p>“But if them fellers finds out I’ve been chinnin’
with the lieutenant they’ll kill me right there on
board the ship.”</p>

<p>“The lieutenant will take care of that. He’ll
see that they have no chance to get at you.”</p>

<p>“Is that certain&mdash;sure&mdash;hard an’ fast?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;certain, sure, hard and fast,” answered
Tom, with a gleefulness that he found it difficult to
keep out of his voice and manner.</p>

<p>Going to the lieutenant and interrupting him in
the directions he was busily giving, Tom said under
his breath:</p>

<p>“Separate the lame man from the rest. He’ll
confess, and it’s a big story. The others will kill
him if they suspect.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant was quick to catch Tom’s meaning
and to act upon it. Turning to a petty officer
he gave the order:</p>

<p>“Take the prisoners aboard under a strong guard.
The rest of the freight can wait. Put the lame
man in my boat and leave him behind under a
guard.”</p>

<p>As the boats containing the prisoners moved off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
down the creek, Tom’s curiosity again got the best
of him. Turning to Larry he said:</p>

<p>“They’re arresting these men without a warrant,
Larry, and we’ve helped them to do the very
thing you said we ought to fight to prevent.”</p>

<p>“No warrant is needed in this case. The gang
has been ‘caught in the act’ of committing crime,
and caught with the goods on them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” said Tom. “That makes all the
difference in the world.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LAME MAN’S CONFESSION</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Come</span>, Tom, let’s go aboard,” said the lieutenant,
as soon as the boat that carried the prisoners
was well away down the creek. “A quartermaster
can finish up what there is to do here, and I’m anxious
to let you boys get away on your sporting trip
as soon as possible; but I simply can’t let you go
till&mdash;till we finish the matter you spoke of just
now. If we can manage that to-night I’ll send
you on your way rejoicing as early to-morrow
morning as you please.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for all of us,” said Tom, as the
two, with the lame man and his guards, seated
themselves in the waiting boat; “but you mustn’t
think this thing has interfered with us. It has
been right in our line and strictly according to the
programme.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” the lieutenant asked, enjoying
Tom’s evident relish for the experience he had just
gone through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, you see we set out not merely for sport,
but with the declared purpose of seeking ‘sport
and adventure.’ This thing has been sport to us,
and you’ll not deny that it has had a distinct flavor
of adventure in it.”</p>

<p>“Tom, you ought to be a sailor or a soldier,”
was the officer’s only reply.</p>

<p>As soon as they went aboard the lieutenant ordered
the lame man taken to his own cabin and the
rest of the prisoners to the forehold under a strong
guard. When the other boys, who were closely
following, came over the side, he invited the four
to go with him to his quarters.</p>

<p>“Stop a minute, though. Tell me just what
you’ve arranged, Tom, so that I may know how to
proceed.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve drawn a little information out of
the lame man and got him to promise more&mdash;all
he knows in fact, and that seems to be a good deal.
These outlaws are only the agents of conspirators
‘higher up,’ as the phrase goes&mdash;ruffians hired by
the conspirators to do the work and take the risks,
while the men higher up pocket all the proceeds
except the pittance allowed to their hired outlaws.
The red-faced bully down there, who acts as captain
of the band, seems to be an exception to all
this. According to the lame man, that burly brute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
was the originator of the conspiracy, he and some
man named Pedro Mendez.”</p>

<p>“What? Pedro Mendez?” interrupted the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“That’s the name the lame man mentioned. Do
you know Pedro, or know who he is?”</p>

<p>“I should say I do. He’s&mdash;by the way, he’s
the owner of the good ship <i>Senorita</i>, from whose
cargo some of the smuggled goods came! Wait a
minute.”</p>

<p>The officer pressed a button and a subordinate
promptly appeared to receive orders.</p>

<p>“Tell Mr. Chisolm to get the ship under way
as soon as all the boats are aboard, and steam at
full speed for Beaufort.”</p>

<p>When the orderly had disappeared, the lieutenant
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I must get to a telegraph office before morning,
and we’ll have the smiling Pedro under arrest
in Baltimore before another night comes. Go on,
Tom! This is the biggest haul made in ten years
and we have you boys to thank for it. Go on,
please.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much more for me to tell. The
lame man will tell the rest. He has a grudge
against the red-faced captain&mdash;a life and death enmity&mdash;I
should say&mdash;and it is chiefly to get his foe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
into all possible trouble that he is willing to tell
all he knows. I’ve assured him that if he gives
the information necessary to secure the capture
of the whole gang and the breaking up the business,
the authorities are pretty sure to let him off easily.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Now we’ll go to the cabin
and see how much our man can tell.”</p>

<p>What the lame man told the lieutenant has no
place in this story. He knew, as Tom had supposed,
practically all that was needed, and once
started in his story he told it all.</p>

<p>It was taken down in shorthand as he told it,
and after some difficulties with the pen the man
signed it, the four boys signing as witnesses. A
few days later the newspapers were filled with news
of a “stupendous Revenue capture” and the arrest
of a number of highly respectable men caught
in a conspiracy to defraud the Government.</p>

<p>When the confessing prisoner had been removed
to secure quarters for the night the officer shook
hands warmly with the boys, saying:</p>

<p>“You young men have rendered a much greater
service to the Government than you can well imagine,
and as an officer commissioned by the Government
I want to thank you for it as adequately as
I can. It is not only that some smugglers have
been captured as a result of what you have done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and a lot of smuggled goods seized. That, indeed,
is the smallest part of it. This capture will make
an end to this sort of smuggling for all time. I
was sent here six weeks ago expressly to accomplish
this purpose, and but for you young men and
the assistance you have given me I doubt that I
should ever have accomplished it at all, although,
as you know, a half company of marines was furnished
me in addition to the ship’s own force, in
order that I might be strong enough for any emergency.</p>

<p>“Now if I talked all night I couldn’t thank you
enough. Let me turn to another matter. I promised
you to set you afloat at any point you wish,
and I’ll do it. But I’m taking you to Beaufort now
because I <i>must</i> get to a telegraph office. As soon
as I possibly can in the morning I’ll steam to the
point you choose.”</p>

<p>“Beaufort suits us very well, indeed,” Larry answered.
“You see we’re short of stores and when
we’re afloat again we’ll lay our course for a region
where no stores can be had except such as we can
secure with our shotguns.”</p>

<p>“What stores do you need?” asked the officer.</p>

<p>“Coffee, a side of bacon to fry fish with, two
hams, and as many boxes of ship biscuit as we
can manage to stow away in our boat. That’s all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
except some salt, I think. I suppose we can buy
all such things at Beaufort. If not, we can go
without them.”</p>

<p>“No, you can’t buy them at Beaufort or anywhere
else,” the lieutenant answered; “because I’m
going to furnish them from my own ship’s stores.”</p>

<p>“But, Lieutenant,” said Larry, flushing, “your
stores belong to the Government, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly. What of that?”</p>

<p>“Why, we can’t let you give us goods that belong
to the Government.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see your scruple, but you’re wrong about
the facts. It is a part of every revenue cutter’s
duty to provision craft in distress, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But pardon me, we are not in distress. It is
only that for our comfort we need certain supplies
that we are perfectly well able to buy, and when we
get to Beaufort a market will be open to us. We’ll
provision ourselves, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d let me do it. It is little enough,
in all conscience, considering the service you’ve rendered
the Government.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t do that for pay,” Larry answered.</p>

<p>“I quite understand that. Still I have full authority
to issue the stores to you, and the disposition
made of them will of course be set forth in my
official report.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, very much, for your good will in
the matter,” Larry said, in a tone that left no
chance for further argument, “but we prefer to
buy for ourselves. Then if you’ll have your men
lower our boat, we’ll say ‘Good-bye and good luck’
to you and take ourselves off your hands.”</p>

<p>“That is final?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;final.”</p>

<p>“Very well. It shall be as you say. But I’m
sorry you won’t let me do even so small a thing
as that by way of showing you my gratitude.”</p>

<p>A little later Larry sought out the lieutenant on
deck.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what you may do for us, Lieutenant,
if you are still so minded.”</p>

<p>“Of course I am. I’ll do whatever you suggest.
What is it?”</p>

<p>“Why, write a brief letter to Tom and let me
have it for delivery after we get away from Beaufort.
He’ll cherish that as long as he lives, and you
see after all it was Tom who did it all. He first
found the smugglers’ camp and investigated it; he
made the later reconnoissance on which you acted,
and he led the&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say no more,” the lieutenant answered. “I’ll
write the letter and give it to you.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant had another thought in mind;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
he did not mention it; but when at last the boys
got back to Charleston, they found a letter awaiting
each of them, a letter of thanks and commendation.
Those letters were not from the commanding
officer of a revenue cutter, but from the Secretary
of the Treasury himself, and they were
signed by his own hand.</p>

<p>All that occurred later, however. At present the
story has to do only with what further adventures
the boys encountered in their coast wanderings.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXV</h2>

<p class="pch">A SIGNAL OF DISTRESS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Hunkydory</i> was loaded to the point of inconvenience
when, about noon, she set sail again. For
it was the purpose of the boys to make their way
to Quasi quickly now, stopping only long enough
here and there to replenish their supply of game
and fish, and they wanted to be free to stay as long
as they pleased at Quasi, when at last they should
reach that place, without being compelled to hurry
away in search of supplies. Accordingly they
bought at Beaufort all the hard bread, coffee and
other such things that they could in any wise induce
the dory to make room for.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Dory dear,” Cal said to the boat
as he squeezed in a dozen cans of condensed milk
for which it was hard to find a place. “Never
mind, Dory dear; with four such appetites as ours
to help you out, your load will rapidly grow lighter,
and when we get to Quasi we’ll relieve you of it
altogether.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>It was planned to establish a comfortable little
camp at Quasi, to hunt and fish at will, to rest when
that seemed the best thing to do, and to indulge
in that limitless talk which intelligent boys rejoice
in when freed for a time from all obligation to do
anything else. In short, a considerable period of
camping at Quasi had come to be regarded as the
main purpose of the voyage. With their guns
and their fishing tackle, the boys had no concern for
their meat supply, but, as Cal said:</p>

<p>“We can’t expect to flush coveys of ship biscuit
or catch coffee on tight lines, so we must take
as much as we can of that sort of provender.”</p>

<p>About two o’clock on the afternoon of the third
day of their voyage from Beaufort the boat was
lazily edging her way through an almost perfectly
smooth sea, with just a sufficient suggestion of
breeze to give her steerage way. Tom was at the
tiller, with next to nothing to do there. Larry and
Dick were dozing in the shadow of the mainsail,
while Cal, after his custom, was watching the porpoises
at play and the gulls circling about overhead
and everything else that could be watched whether
there was any apparent reason for watching it or
not.</p>

<p>Presently he turned to Tom and, indicating his
meaning by an inclination of the head toward a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
peninsula five or six miles away, which had just
come into view as the boat cleared a marsh island,
said:</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>“What’s it? and what is it?” asked Tom, too indolent
now to disentangle his sentences.</p>

<p>“Quasi,” said Cal.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Over the port bow. Change your course a
little to starboard&mdash;there’s a mud bank just under
water ahead and we must sail round it.”</p>

<p>“Quasi at last!” exclaimed Tom gleefully, as
he pushed the helm to port and hauled in the sheet
a trifle in order to spill none of the all too scanty
breeze.</p>

<p>Instantly Dick and Larry were wide awake, and
for a time conversation quickened as Cal pointed
out the salient features of the land ahead.</p>

<p>“How far away do you reckon it, Cal?” asked
Dick.</p>

<p>“About five miles.”</p>

<p>“Is it clear water? Can we lay a straight
course?”</p>

<p>“Yes, after we clear this mud bank. A little
more to starboard, Tom, or you’ll go aground.”</p>

<p>“We ought to make it by nightfall then,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Larry&mdash;“unless this plaything of a breeze fails us
entirely.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make it sooner than that,” said Dick,
standing up and steadying himself by the mast.
“Look, Cal. There’s business in that.”</p>

<p>Dick had seen white caps coming in between two
islands ahead, and had rightly judged that in her
present position the dory was temporarily blanketed
by a great island that lay between it and the sea.</p>

<p>“I don’t need to stand up,” answered Cal, “and
it’s hot. I saw the sea running in ahead. I’d have
suggested a resort to the oars if I hadn’t. As it is,
we’ll toy with this infantile zephyr for half an
hour more. By that time we’ll clear the land here
and set our caps on a little tighter or have them
carried away. That’s a stiff blow out there, and
by the way, we’re catching the ragged edges of it
already. A little more to starboard, Tom, and
jibe the boom over.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be windward work all the way,” said
Larry, as he looked out ahead.</p>

<p>“So much the better,” said Cal, who found
something to rejoice in in every situation. “It’ll
blow the ‘hot’ off us before we make Quasi, and
besides, there’s nothing like sailing on the wind if
the wind happens to be stiff enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’ll be stiff enough presently,” said Larry;
then after looking about for a moment, he added:
“I only hope we sha’n’t ship enough water to
dampen down our clothes. The dory is <i>very</i> heavily
loaded.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” said Dick. “She’s built to
carry a heavy load in a rough sea and a high wind.
In fact, she points up better and foots better, carries
herself better every way when she has a load
on than when she hasn’t.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” muttered Cal, going to the helm where
Tom was manifesting some distrust of his own
skill in the freshening wind and the “lumpy” seaway
they were beginning to meet. “I’ve known
men to think they were like the <i>Hunkydory</i> in
that.”</p>

<p>“Diagram it, Cal,” said Larry.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve seen men who thought they could do
things better with a ‘load on’ than without. Trim
ship! I’m going to take the other tack.”</p>

<p>Then, as the boat heeled over to starboard, her
rail fairly making the water boil, Cal completed
his sentence. “But they were mistaken.”</p>

<p>“It’s different with boats,” Dick answered;
“and besides, the dory’s ‘load’ is of quite another
sort.”</p>

<p>Sailing on the wind with a skittish boat of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
dory type is about as exhilarating a thing, when
the wind pipes high and the sea surges white with
foam, as can be imagined. In order that the pleasure
of it might not all be his, Cal presently surrendered
the tiller to Dick, who in his turn gave
it over to Larry after his own pulses were set a-tingle.
Larry offered Tom his turn, but Tom modestly
refused, doubting the sufficiency of his skill for
such work as this.</p>

<p>“The tools to those who can use them, is sound
philosophy, I think,” he said in refusing. “Besides,
I don’t want to be responsible if we turn turtle
before we reach Quasi, after all our trouble.”</p>

<p>After half an hour or so of speedy windward
work the <i>Hunkydory</i> drew near enough to Quasi
for Cal to study details of the shore line somewhat.
Lying in the bow, just under the jib, he was silently
but diligently engaged in scrutinizing every feature
he could make out in a shore that lay half a mile
or a trifle more away. The others asked him questions
now and then, but he made no answer. Under
his general instructions the dory was skirting
along the shore, making short legs, so as to maintain
her half mile distance until Cal should find the
place he was looking for as a landing.</p>

<p>Presently he turned and spoke to Dick, who was
now at the tiller again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Run in a quarter of a mile, Dick, and bring us
nearer shore,” he said.</p>

<p>Dick obeyed, while Cal seemed to be studying
something on shore with more than ordinary interest.
Presently he said:</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong over there. As soon
as we round the point ahead, Dick, you’ll have
fairly sheltered water and sloping sands. Beach
her there.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Cal? What’s the matter? Why
do you say there’s something wrong?” These
questions were promptly hurled at Cal’s head by his
companions.</p>

<p>“Look!” he answered. “Do you see the little
flag up there on top of the bluff? It is flying
union down&mdash;a signal of distress. But I can’t
make out anybody there. Can any of you?”</p>

<p>All eyes were strained now, but no living thing
could be seen anywhere along the shore. Tom
ventured a suggestion:</p>

<p>“The flag is badly faded and a good deal
whipped out, as if it had been flying there for a
long time. Perhaps the people who put it up have
all died since.”</p>

<p>“No, they haven’t,” answered Cal.</p>

<p>“Why, do you see anybody?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. But I see a little curling smoke that probably
rises from a half burned-out camp-fire.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right then?” half asked, half declared
Tom.</p>

<p>“You forget the flag flying union down, Tom.
That isn’t suggestive of all-rightness. Bring her
around quick, Dick, and beach her there just under
the bluff!”</p>

<p>Half a minute more and the dory lay with her
head well up on the sloping sand. The boys all
leaped ashore except Larry, who busied himself
housing the mast and sails and making things snug.
The rest scrambled up the bluff, which was an earth
bank about twenty feet high and protected at its
base by a closely welded oyster bank.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXVI</h2>

<p class="pch">AN UNEXPECTED INTERRUPTION</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was nobody near the half burned-out
camp-fire, but there were evidences in plenty of the
fact that somebody had cooked and eaten there
that day. There were no cooking utensils lying
about, but there was a structure of green sticks
upon which somebody had evidently been roasting
meat; there were freshly opened oyster shells scattered
around&mdash;“the beginnings of a kitchen midden,”
Dick observed&mdash;and many other small indications
of recent human presence. Especially,
Cal noticed, that some smouldering brands of the
fire had been carefully buried in ashes&mdash;manifestly
to serve as the kindlers of a fresh fire when
one should be needed. Finally, Tom discovered
a hunting knife with its point stuck into the bark
of a tree, as if its owner had planned to secure it
in that way until it should be needed again, just
as a house-wife hangs up her gridiron when done
with it for the time being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>As the three were discovering these things and
interpreting their meaning, Larry joined them and
suggested a search of the woods and thickets round
about.</p>

<p>“Why not try nature’s own method first?” Tom
asked.</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Yelling. That’s the way a baby does when it
wants to attract attention, and it generally accomplishes
its purpose. That’s why I call it nature’s
own method. Besides, it covers more ground than
looking can, especially in an undergrowth as thick
as that around this little open spot.”</p>

<p>“It is rather thick,” said Larry, looking round
him.</p>

<p>“Thick? Why, a cane brake is wind-swept
prairie land in comparison. Let’s yell all together
and see if we can’t make the hermit of Quasi
hear.”</p>

<p>The experiment was tried, not once, but many
times, with no effect, and a search of the immediate
vicinity proved equally futile.</p>

<p>“There seems to be nothing to do but wait,”
Larry declared, at last. “The man in distress
must have gone away in search of food. He is
starving perhaps, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not quite that,” said Cal. “He may be craving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
a tapioca pudding or some other particular article
of diet, but he isn’t starving.”</p>

<p>“How do you know, Cal?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is only that he has a haunch of venison&mdash;sun-crusted
for purposes of preservation&mdash;hanging
in that tree there”&mdash;pointing&mdash;“and unless
he is more different kinds of a lunatic than the
chief engineer of any insane asylum ever heard of,
he wouldn’t starve with that on hand.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is spoiled,” said Tom, looking up
the tree where the venison hung and where Cal
alone had seen it.</p>

<p>“It isn’t spoiled, either,” answered Cal, with assurance.</p>

<p>“But how can you tell when you’re ten or twenty
feet away from it?” Tom stopped to ask.</p>

<p>“The carrion crows can tell at almost any distance,”
Cal returned, “and if it were even tainted,
they’d be quarreling over it.”</p>

<p>Tom was not satisfied, and so he climbed the
tree to inspect. Sliding down again, he gave judgment:</p>

<p>“Why, the thing’s as black as ink and as hard
as the bark of a white oak tree. It’s dried beef&mdash;or
dried venison, rather.”</p>

<p>“You’re mistaken, Tom,” said Larry. “It is
sun-crusted, as Cal said, but that’s very different.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Inside it is probably as juicy as a steak from a
stall-fed ox.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘sun-crusted,’” asked
Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” Larry answered. “You and Tom
are not familiar with our way of preserving meat
in emergencies. When we are out hunting and
have a joint of fresh red meat that we want to keep
fresh, we don’t salt it or smoke it or do anything
of that sort to it. We just hang it out in the very
strongest sunlight we can find. In a brief while
the surface of the meat is dried into a thin black
crust as hard as wood, and after that it will keep
for days in any cool, shady place. Flies cannot
bore through the hard crust, and the air itself is
shut out from the meat below the surface.”</p>

<p>“How long will it keep in that way?”</p>

<p>“How long, Cal?” asked Larry, referring the
question to his brother’s larger experience.</p>

<p>“That depends on several things,” Cal answered.
“I’ve kept meat in that way for a week or ten
days, and at other times I’ve eaten my whole supply
at the first meal. But I say, fellows, we’re
wasting precious time. The night cometh when no
man can work, and we have a good deal to do before
it comes. We must find a safe anchorage for
the <i>Hunkydory</i> and set up a camp for ourselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
In aid of that we must find fresh water, and I have
an idea we’ll find that somewhere along under the
line of bluffs&mdash;at some point where they trend
well back from the shore with a sandy beach between.
The hermit must get water from somewhere
near, and there’s no sign of any around
here.”</p>

<p>Cal’s conjecture proved to be right. A little
spring at the foot of the bluff had been dug out
and framed around with sticks to keep the margin
from crumbling.</p>

<p>Obviously this was the hermit’s source of water
supply.</p>

<p>“But why in the name of common sense,” said
Larry, “didn’t he set up his Lares and Penates
somewhere near the spring?”</p>

<p>“I can think of two reasons,” Cal answered,
“either of which is sufficient to answer your question.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead&mdash;what are they?”</p>

<p>“One is, that he may be a crank, and another
is, that he may be a prudent, sensible person, preferring
comfort with inconvenience, to convenience
with discomfort.”</p>

<p>“Now, then, Sphinx, unravel your riddle.”</p>

<p>“Its meaning ought to be obvious,” Cal
drawled, “but as it isn’t, I’ll explain it. The man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
is probably a crank. If not, he wouldn’t have set
up a signal of distress and then have gone away
and hidden himself so that if rescuers came they
couldn’t find him. To a crank like that any foolishness
is easily possible. On the other hand, if
he happens to be a man of practical common sense&mdash;as
there is equally good reason to believe&mdash;he
would very naturally pitch his camp up where it is,
rather than here where you fellows are already
fighting the sand flies that will be heavily reinforced
toward nightfall.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” said the others.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s so. Anybody would know that,
after slapping his cheeks till they feel as if they
had been cured with mustard plasters, and weren’t
half well yet.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Cal?” Tom asked.</p>

<p>“Why, imitate the hermit and improve upon his
ideas.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;” began Larry.</p>

<p>“I mean we must go up on the bluff and pitch our
camp a hundred yards or so back from the beach.
Otherwise we shall all be bored as full of holes as
a colander before we stretch our weary limbs upon
mother earth for sleep.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Tom, “but you haven’t
told us about the improvement upon the hermit’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
ideas. Do you mean we should go farther back
from the water?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t mean that, though we’ll do it. I
meant that instead of carrying water from this
brackish spring we’ll dig a well where we pitch our
tent of palmete leaves.”</p>

<p>“But you said&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know I did; but that was in swampy land where
the only water to be had by digging was an exudation
from muck. It is very different here. These
bluffs and all the high ground that lies back of
them are composed of clean clay and clean sand.
Look at the bank and see for yourself. Now all
we’ve got to do to get sweet, wholesome water
anywhere on the higher land&mdash;which isn’t as high
a little way back as it is here at the face of the
bluff&mdash;is to dig down to the level of the sea.
There we’ll find sea water that has been freed from
salt and all other impurities by siping through a
mixture of clay and sand that is as perfect a filter
as can be imagined.”</p>

<p>“Now if you’ve finished that cataract of words,
Cal,” said Larry, “we must get to work or night
will be on us before we’re ready for it. You go
and pick out a camping place, and the rest of us
will follow you with things from the boat. We
can dig the well and build a shelter to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>But Tom and Dick were full of enthusiasm, now
that they had at last got to Quasi, and they had
both tasted the water of the spring. Its flavor
strongly stimulated their eagerness for something
more palatable.</p>

<p>“Why not begin the well now&mdash;as soon as we
get the things up from the boat?” asked Dick.
“There’ll be a moon nearly full, and the sea breeze
here is cool. I for one am ready to dig till midnight.”</p>

<p>“I’ll dig all night,” said Tom, “rather than take
another swig of that stuff. If we work hard we
can get the well in commission before we use all
the water left in the kegs.”</p>

<p>“We sha’n’t have to dig all night,” said Cal.
“I’ll pick out a place where we needn’t go down
more than eight or nine feet, and this sandy earth
is easily handled. If we’re really industrious and
don’t waste more time over supper than we must,
we’ll strike water within a few hours, and it’ll be
settled and clear by morning. But we must hustle
if we’re to do that. So load yourselves up while
I pick out a camp and I’ll join the caravan of carriers
in the next load.”</p>

<p>It was necessary, of course, to remove everything
from the boat to the bivouac, as it was the
purpose of the company to make this their headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
for several weeks to come, or at least for as
long as they liked.</p>

<p>It was nearly sunset, therefore, when that part
of the work was done, and it was decreed that
Larry should get supper while the rest worked at
well-digging.</p>

<p>As there remained no fresh meat among their
stores, Larry’s first task was to go out with his gun
in search of game. Squirrels were abundant all
about the place, and very easily shot, as they had
never been hunted. As the time was short, Larry
contented himself with the killing of a dozen or so
of the fat rodents, suppressing for the time being
his strong impulse to go after game of a more elusive
and therefore more aristocratic sort. He did
indeed take one shot at a flock of rice birds, killing
a good many of them, but mutilating their tender
little butter-balls of bodies because he used
bird shot instead of the “mustard seed” size,
which alone is fit for rice-bird shooting.</p>

<p>On his return to the bivouac to cook his game, he
found the well already sunk to nearly half the required
depth, and by the time he was ready to bid
his comrades cease their work and come to supper,
at least another foot had been added to its depth.</p>

<p>The work was easy, not only because the sandy
soil was easily shoveled out without the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
picks or spades, but because of the form Cal’s observation
of other temporary well digging had
taught him to give to the excavation.</p>

<p>“We’re not really digging a well,” he explained
at the outset. “We’re only scooping out a basin
in order to get to water. So instead of working in
a narrow hole, we’ll take a bowl for our model&mdash;a
bowl eight or ten feet across at the top and growing
rapidly narrower as we go down. Working in
that way, we’ll not only get on faster and with less
labor, but we’ll spare ourselves the necessity of
cribbing up the sides of our water hole to keep
them from falling in. Besides, the farther down
we get the less work each additional foot of digging
will cost us.”</p>

<p>When Larry announced supper, all the company
admitted that they “had their appetites with
them”; but Cal did not at once “fall to” as the
others did. Instead, he went into the woods a little
way, secured a dry, dead and barkless stick about
five feet long, and drove it into the bottom of the
excavation. Pulling it out again after waiting for
twenty or thirty seconds, he closely scrutinized its
end. Then, measuring off a part of it with his
hands so placed as to cover approximately a foot
of space at each application, he tossed the stick
aside and joined the others at their meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Nobody interrupted the beginning of his supper
by asking him questions, but after he had devoured
two or three rice birds the size of marbles and had
begun on the hind leg of a broiled squirrel which
lay upon an open baked sweet potato, he volunteered
a hint of what he had been doing.</p>

<p>“As nearly as I can measure it with my hands,
we’ll come to water about three feet further down,
boys. We’ve acquitted ourselves nobly as sappers
and miners, and are entitled to take plenty of time
for supper and a good little rest afterwards&mdash;say
till the moon, which is just now coming up out of
its bath in the sea out there, rises high enough to
shine into our hole. That will be an hour hence,
perhaps, and then we’ll shovel sand like plasterers
making mortar. It won’t take us more than an
hour or so to finish the job, and we’ll get to sleep
long before midnight.”</p>

<p>“How did you find out how far down the water
was, Cal,” asked Tom, who was always as hungry
for information as a school boy is for green apples
or any other thing that carries a threat of stomach
ache with it.</p>

<p>“Why, I drove a dry stick down&mdash;one that
would show a wetting if it got it&mdash;till it moved
easily up and down. I knew then that it had
reached the water-saturated sand. I pushed it on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
down till the upper end was level with our present
bottom. Then I drew it out and measured the
dry part and six inches or so of the wet. That
told me how far down we must go for the water.”</p>

<p>“It’s very simple,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed that most things are so when one
understands them,” said Dick. “For example&mdash;”</p>

<p>What Dick’s example was there is now no way
of finding out, for at that point in his little speech
the conversation was interrupted by a rather oddly-dressed
man who broke through the barrier of
bushes and presented himself, bowing and smiling,
to the company.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXVII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE HERMIT OF QUASI</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> newcomer was a man of fifty or fifty-five
years of age. He was slender, but rather
with the slenderness of the red Indian than with
that suggestive of weakness. Indeed, the boys observed
that his muscles seemed to be developed out
of proportion to his frame, as if he had been intended
by nature for a scholar and had made an
athlete of himself instead.</p>

<p>There was not an ounce of unnecessary fat upon
his person, and yet he gave no sign of being underfed.
Instead his flesh had the peculiar hardness
of the frontiersman’s who eats meat largely in excess
of other foods.</p>

<p>A little strip across the upper part of his forehead,
which showed as he stood there with his hat
removed, suggested that his complexion had once
been fair, but that exposure had tanned it to the
color of a saddle.</p>

<p>His costume was an odd one, but it was made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the best of materials, now somewhat worn, but fit
still to hold their own in comparison with far newer
garments of cheaper quality. Perhaps they were
aided in this by the fact that they had evidently
been made for him by some tailor who knew how to
make clothes set upon their wearer as if they were
a part of him.</p>

<p>Yet his dress was perfectly simple. He wore a
sort of Norfolk jacket of silk corduroy&mdash;a cloth
well nigh as durable as sole leather&mdash;with
breeches of the same, buttoned at and below the
knee, and covered at bottom with close-fitting calf-skin
leggings of the kind that grooms and dandy
horsemen affect.</p>

<p>The hat he held in his hand, as he addressed the
company that had courteously risen to receive him,
was an exceedingly limp felt affair, soft to the
head, light in weight and capable of assuming any
shape its wearer might choose to give it. His
shoes were Indian moccasins.</p>

<p>No sign of linen appeared anywhere about his
person, but just above the top button of his jacket
a bit of gray flannel shirt showed in color harmony
with his other garments.</p>

<p>“Good evening, young gentlemen,” he said; “I
trust I do not intrude, and if I do so it shall not be
for long. My name is Rudolf Dunbar. May I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
ask if you young gentlemen are the rescuers I have
been hoping to see during the three or four weeks
that I have been marooned on this peninsula which
nobody seems ever to visit?”</p>

<p>“We are here to rescue you if you so desire,”
answered Larry, “but we set out with no such
purpose. We were on our way here to fish, hunt,
live in the open air and be happy in natural ways
for a time. We caught sight of your signal of
distress and hurried ourselves as much as possible,
fearing that your distress might be extreme. As
we found your camp showing no signs of starvation
or illness, and could not find you, we set to work
to establish ourselves for a prolonged stay here and
wait for you to return. It seemed the only thing to
do under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Quite right! Quite right! and I thank you for
your kindly impulse. But you should have taken
possession of my camp, making it your own&mdash;at
least until you could establish yourselves more to
your liking. I don’t know, though&mdash;my camp is
bare of everything, so that you’re better off as you
are.”</p>

<p>As he paused, Larry introduced himself and his
comrades by name, and offered the stranger the
hospitality of their camp, inviting him especially to
sit down and share their supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>He accepted the invitation, and after a little
Larry said to him:</p>

<p>“May I ask the nature of your distress here,
and how pressing it is? We are ready, of course,
to take you to the village over yonder, ten or a
dozen miles away, at any time you like. From
there you can go anywhere you please.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much. My distress is quite
over now. Indeed, I am not accustomed to let circumstances
distress me overmuch. I found myself
marooned here, and naturally I wanted to establish
communication with the mainland again&mdash;or the
possibility of such communication. But if it had
been necessary I could have remained here for a
year in fair contentment. Long experience has
taught me how to reconcile myself with my surroundings,
whatever they may be, and game and
fish are plentiful here. May I ask how long you
young gentlemen have planned to remain here?”</p>

<p>“Three or four weeks, probably,” answered
Larry. “But as I said before, we’ll set you ashore
on the mainland at any time you like.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much. But if it will be quite
agreeable to you, I’ll remain here as long as you
do. I haven’t finished my work here, and the
place is extremely favorable for my business. If
my presence is in any way annoying&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, not at all. We shall build a comfortable
shelter to-morrow, and we’ll be glad to have you
for our guest. As you see, we’re digging a well,
and we’ll have good sweet water by morning.”</p>

<p>“That is very wise. I should have dug one myself
if I had had any sort of implement to dig with,
but I have none.”</p>

<p>“And so you’ve had to get on with the rather
repulsive water from the spring down there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and no. I have used that water, but I
distil it first. You see, in my peculiar business, I
must wander in all sorts of places, wholesome and
unwholesome, and it is often impossible to find good
water to drink. So for years past I have always
carried a little distilling apparatus of my own devising
with me. It is very small and very light, and,
of course, when I have to depend upon it for a
water supply, I must use water very sparingly. I
think I must bid you good evening now, as I did
not sleep at all last night. I will see you in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“We’ll expect you to join us at breakfast,” said
Larry.</p>

<p>“It will give me great pleasure to do so. Good
night.”</p>

<p>With that he nimbly tripped away, leaving the
boys to wonder who and what he was, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
what the “business” was that he had not
yet finished at Quasi. Cal interrupted the chatter
presently, saying:</p>

<p>“We’ve annexed a riddle, and you’re wasting
time trying to guess it out. Nobody ever did guess
the answer to a riddle. Let’s get to work and finish
the well.”</p>

<p>The boys set to work, of course, but they did
not cease to speculate concerning the stranger.
Even after the well was finished and when they
should all have been asleep they could not drive the
subject from their minds.</p>

<p>“I wonder how he got here, anyhow,” said Tom,
after all the other subjects of wonder had been discussed
to no purpose. “He has no boat and he
couldn’t have got here without one.”</p>

<p>“What I wonder,” said Dick, “is why and how
his ‘business’ has compelled him to wander in out-of-the-way
places, as he says he has.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> am wondering,” said Cal, sleepily, “when
you fellows will stop talking and let me go to sleep.
You can’t find out anything by wondering and chattering.
The enigma will read itself to us very
soon.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean he’ll tell us his story?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why do you think he’ll do that?”</p>

<p>“He can’t possibly help it. When a man lives
alone for so long as he has done, he must talk about
himself. It’s the only thing he knows, and the only
thing that seems to him interesting.”</p>

<p>“There’s a better reason than that,” said Larry.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Why, that he is obviously a gentleman. A
gentleman wouldn’t think of coming here to remain
indefinitely as our guest without letting us know
who and what he is and all the rest of it.”</p>

<p>“<i>Finis!</i>” said Cal.</p>

<p>Silence followed, and soon the little company
was dreaming of queerly dressed marooners carrying
flags union down.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">RUDOLF DUNBAR’S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cal</span> and Larry were right. Both out of a sense
of duty to his entertainers and because of a not
unnatural impulse to tell of his unusual mode of
life, Dunbar began the very next morning to talk
freely of his experiences.</p>

<p>“It is proper that I explain to you how I came
to be here without the means of getting away
again,” he said at breakfast. “Indeed, I was a
little troubled in my mind last night when I remembered
that I had received your kindly offer of rescue
without telling you that. But in my anxiety to get
away from your bivouac and let you sleep, I forgot
it.</p>

<p>“You see my entire life is spent in the woods
or upon the water. I go wherever there is promise
of anything to reward the labors of a naturalist,
and when I heard of this long-abandoned plantation,
where for twenty-five years or so Nature has
had things all her own way, I knew a visit would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
be richly worth while. So I purchased a little rowboat
and came over here about three or four weeks
ago. I cannot fix the time more definitely because I
never can keep accurate account of the days or weeks,
living alone in the woods as I do and having no engagements
to fulfill. I pulled my boat up on the
beach a little way, selected a place in which to live,
and proceeded to remove my things from the boat
to the place chosen. Unfortunately, just as I had
finished doing so, a peculiar moth attracted my
attention&mdash;a moth not mentioned or described in
any of the books, and quite unknown to science,
I think. I went at once in chase of it, but it led
me a merry dance through the thickets, and it was
two hours, I should say&mdash;though I carry no timepiece&mdash;before
I caught the creature. In the meanwhile
I had forgotten all about my boat, and when
I got back I saw it drifting out to sea with quite a
strong breeze to aid the tide in carrying it away.
It seems the tide had reached the flood during my
absence, setting the boat afloat, and had then begun
to ebb, carrying her away.</p>

<p>“There was nothing to be done, of course, but
hoist my little flag, union down, and go on with
the very interesting task of studying the habits of
my new moth, of which I have since found several
specimens, besides three cocoons which I am hatching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
in the hope that they will prove to belong to the
species. I’ve been hard at work at that task ever
since, and I have made some very interesting discoveries
with regard to that moth’s choice of habitat.
I made the most important one the night before
you arrived. That is why I got no sleep that
night.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope,” said Cal, “that the excitement of
it did not interfere with your rest last night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all. I am never excited, and I can
sleep whenever I choose. I have only to lie down
and close my eyes in order to accomplish that.”</p>

<p>“Then you have a shelter or hut up there somewhere&mdash;though
we saw none?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I never sleep under shelter of any
kind; I haven’t done so for more than twenty years
past. Indeed, that is one of the conditions upon
which I live at all. My health is good now, but it
would fail me rapidly if I slept anywhere under a
roof.”</p>

<p>“But when these heavy subtropical rains
come?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Ah, I am prepared for them. I have only to
spread one rubber cloth on the ground and a much
thinner one over my blanket, and I take no harm.”</p>

<p>“Your specialty then is the study of butterflies
and moths?” asked Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, not at all. Indeed I have no specialty.
When I was teaching I held the chair of Natural
History, with several specialists as tutors under
my general direction. When my health broke down&mdash;pray,
don’t suppose I am going to weary you
with a profitless catalogue of symptoms&mdash;I simply
had to take to the woods. I had nobody dependent
upon me&mdash;nobody for whom it was my duty to provide
then or later. I had a little money, very little,
but living as I do I need very little, and my work
yields me a good deal more than I need or want.
The little rifle I always have with me provides me
with all the food I want, so that I am rarely under
expense on that account.”</p>

<p>“But you must have bread or some substitute,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“I do not find it necessary. When I have access
to starchy foods&mdash;of which there are many in
tropical and subtropical forests if one knows how
to find and utilize them&mdash;I eat them with relish,
but when they are not to be had I get on very well
without them. You see man is an omnivorous
animal, and can live in health upon either starchy
or flesh foods. It is best to have both, of course,
unless the starchy foods are perverted as they so
often are in civilized life, and made ministers to
depraved appetites.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“May I ask just how you mean that?” asked
Dick.</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly. The starch we consumed last
night in the form of sweet potatoes was altogether
good for us; so is that we are taking now in these
ship biscuits. But if the flour we are eating had
been mixed with lard, sugar, eggs, milk and the
like, and made into pastry, we should be greatly
the better without it.</p>

<p>“However, I’m not a physician, equipped to deliver
a lecture on food stuffs and their preparation.
I was betrayed into that by your question. I was
explaining the extreme smallness of my personal
needs. After food, which costs me nothing, comes
clothing, which costs me very little.”</p>

<p>“Why certainly you are expensively dressed for
woodland wandering,” said Dick. Then instantly
he began an apology for the reference to so purely
personal a matter, but Rudolf Dunbar interrupted
him.</p>

<p>“No apology is due. I was voluntarily talking
of my own personal affairs, and your remark was
entirely pertinent. My garments are made of very
costly fabrics, but as such materials endure all sorts
of hard usage and last for a very long time, I find
it cheaper in the end to buy only such; more important
still is the convenience of it, to one leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the sort of life I do. Instead of having to visit a
tailor three or four times a year, I have need of his
services only at long intervals. The garments I
now have on were made for me in London three
years or so ago, and I have worn no others since.
In the meanwhile I have been up the Amazon for
thousands of miles, besides visiting Labrador and
the southern coast of Greenland.</p>

<p>“That brings me to my principal item of expense,
which is the passage money I must pay in
order to get to the regions I wish to explore. That
costs me a good deal at each considerable removal,
but in the meanwhile I have earned greatly more
by my work.</p>

<p>“But pardon me for prosing so about myself.
I’ll say not another word now, so that you young
gentlemen may be free to make whatever use you
wish of this superb day. I shall spend the greater
part of it in figuring some specimens with my colored
crayons. Good morning!”</p>

<p class="pch">TOM FINDS THINGS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as the visitor disappeared through a
tangled growth of bushes, Larry began marking
out the duties of the day.</p>

<p>“First of all we must make ourselves comfortable,”
he said, as if reflecting.</p>

<p>“That means a bush shelter of some sort,” interrupted
Tom.</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t either,” Larry answered, in a
tone of playfulness like Tom’s own.</p>

<p>“What does it mean, then?”</p>

<p>“It means a shelter&mdash;not ‘of some sort’ as you
say, but of a good sort. The wind blows hard here
sometimes as the place is so exposed to a broad
passage leading to the sea outside. So we must
build something that isn’t easily carried away by a
squall.”</p>

<p>“It would mean a good many other things,” said
Cal, “if I were the architect selected to make designs,
with front elevations, floor plans, estimates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and all the other things they do before beginning
to put up a building.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, Cal, you are to direct the
work,” answered Larry. “You know more about
such things than all the rest of us combined.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, first of all, our palatial country
residence must face directly away from the sea,”
said Cal. “If it had its wide open side in any
other direction we’d be drenched inside of it every
time a rain came in from the sea, and that is where
nearly all the hard rains come from here. Then,
again, if the hovel faced the wrong way it would
be filled full of smoke every time a sea breeze blew,
and in this exposed place that is nearly all the time.
There are seventeen other good and sufficient reasons
for fronting the structure in the way I have
decreed, but the two I have mentioned are sufficient
to occupy and divert your young minds as we
go on with the work. Now let all hands except
Larry busy themselves chopping crotched poles of
the several dimensions that I’ll mark here in the
sand, for lack of other and more civilized stationery.”</p>

<p>With a sharpened stick Cal began writing in the
sand.</p>

<p>“Four poles, 12 feet long, and three or four
inches thick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what do you want me to do, Cal?” asked
Larry.</p>

<p>“Go fishing,” said Cal. “We must have some
dinner after awhile. See if you can’t bring in a
sheepshead or some other fish weighing five or six
pounds and fit for roasting.”</p>

<p>In an instant Larry was off with cast net, shrimp
bucket and some fish lines.</p>

<p>Cal resumed his sand writing, cataloguing the
various sorts and sizes of poles wanted. Presently
he stopped short, muttering:</p>

<p>“But then we’re not lumbermen, and the only
tool we have to chop with is our one poor little
hand ax. It won’t take three of us to wield that toy.
Say, Tom, suppose you take your gun and see if
you can’t get us some game. We’ll do well enough
with fish for dinner, but we must have some meat
for to-night. So go and get some. I know you’re
half crazy to be off in the woods shooting. Dick
and I will work at the poles and palmetes&mdash;that’s
apt alliteration, but it was quite accidental, I assure
you. One can use the ax and the other cut palmete
leaves with his jackknife, exchanging jobs
now and then. We’ll need a great stack of the
palmetes with which to cover the roof and three
sides of our mansion.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, and fortunately they grow very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
thick just out there in the woods,” said Dick. “I
saw them early this morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. I saw them yesterday when I
picked out a place for the camp. Our need of them
was one of the considerations I had in mind. By
the way, Dick”&mdash;the two were busily at work now&mdash;“what
do you think of the professor’s plan of
sleeping?”</p>

<p>“It saves him a lot of trouble,” Dick answered.</p>

<p>“Yes, in one way. But if he had anything with
him that water would spoil, it would make more
trouble than it saves. As he has nothing of the
kind&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How about his reserve ammunition? A man
who depends upon his gun for all his food must
have a lot of cartridges somewhere.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, but his rifle is probably of very small
calibre, so that a good many cartridges can be
packed in a small space. Of course we can’t ask
him.”</p>

<p>At that moment “the professor,” as Cal had
called him, appeared, with profuse apologies.</p>

<p>“It was really inexcusable,” he protested, “for
me to go away as I did when you young gentlemen
had a shelter to build. I should have stayed to
help in the work, as I am to share in its advantages.
But I am so unused to providing shelter for myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
that I quite forgot your larger necessities. Fortunately
I heard the blows of your ax and was reminded
of my duty. I have come at once to assist
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t think of that, Professor,” answered
Cal. “We really need no assistance. My
brother and Tom have gone off for supplies of meat
and fish, but they’ll be back presently, and meanwhile
we two can use the only tools we have for this
kind of work. Besides, you have something of
your own to do.”</p>

<p>“Nothing that may not be as well done at another
time. I must insist upon bearing my share
of the work of constructing a camp which you have
been courteous enough to invite me to share.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t sleep under a roof&mdash;even a
flimsy one of palmete leaves,” objected Dick.
“We invited you to join us here only because we
like good company.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for the compliment. No, I do not
sleep under a roof, but your roof will be a great
convenience and comfort to me in other ways.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see&mdash;” Cal began, but Dunbar broke
in.</p>

<p>“You don’t see how? No, of course not. How
should you? But that is only because you know so little
of my tasks. I must write my scientific reports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and articles carefully and voluminously, and I must
make accurate color drawings of my specimens to
accompany my text. I am badly behind with my
work in these ways, and the very best time to bring
up the arrears is of long, rainy days, when the living
things I must study&mdash;all of them except the
fishes&mdash;are hidden away in such shelters as they
can find. But I cannot sit in the rain and write or
draw. That would only be to spoil materials of
which I have all too little already. So the rainy
days are lost to me, or have been, hitherto. Now
that I am to enjoy your hospitality, I shall sit in
your shelter when it rains, and get a world of writing
and drawing done.”</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate, we shall not need your help in
this work, and we have no tool for you to work with
if we did. As to our little hospitality, it mustn’t and
doesn’t involve any obligation on your part. If it
did it wouldn’t be hospitality at all, but something
very different. Why not put in your time on your
own work?”</p>

<p>“I would, if my head didn’t object,” the man
of science answered rather dejectedly, Cal thought,
but with a smile.</p>

<p>“Have you a headache, then?” the youth asked,
putting as much sympathy into his tone as was possible
to a robust specimen of young manhood who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
had never had a headache in his life. “It must
be very distressing.”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t a headache,” the professor answered.
“I wish it was only that. No, my head
isn’t clear to-day, and when I try to work it gets
things jumbled up a bit. I tried this morning to
write a scientific account of the habits of a certain
fish that these waters bear, and somehow I got him
out into the bushes using wings that I had never
observed before. Now I must go and catch another
specimen of that fish and examine it carefully
to see if the wings are really there or not. You
see in cases of doubt a scientist dares not trust anything
to conjecture or memory. He must examine
and make sure.”</p>

<p>So saying, the professor started off to catch the
fish he wanted. He had spoken in a half jocular
tone and with a mischievous smile playing about
his lips, though his words were serious enough.</p>

<p>“What do you think, Dick?” Cal asked as soon
as the man was well beyond earshot; “is he a
trifle ‘off’? has he lost some of his buttons?”</p>

<p>“Possibly, but I doubt it.”</p>

<p>“But what nonsense he talked!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But did you observe his smile?
He was only doing in his way what you so often
do in yours. Your smile often contradicts your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
words&mdash;making its bow, as it were, to the nonsense
you are uttering. Yet we don’t suspect you of
having slipped your cable.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s it,” said Cal, “but allow me to
suggest that our chatter cuts no palmetes, and
we’re in need of a great number.”</p>

<p>By the time the needed poles and crotch sticks
were cut and sharpened for driving into the ground,
Larry returned, bringing with him one huge fish
and a bucket full of croakers and whiting, all of
which he had dressed on the shore.</p>

<p>He wrapped the large fish in a mass of wet sea
weed and buried it in the hot ashes and coals to
bake. After setting such other things to cook as
he thought necessary, he joined the others in the
work of setting up the poles and fastening their
ends securely together with vines as flexible as
hempen rope. The wetter parts of the woodlands
yielded such vines in abundance, and as somewhat
experienced sailors the boys all knew how to tie
knots that no strain could loosen.</p>

<p>By the time that the dinner was cooked the
framework of the shelter was more than half done.</p>

<p>“We’ll knock off for dinner now,” Larry suggested,
“and after dinner the whole force will set
to work finishing the framework and covering it.
There are bunks to be made, too, and filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
long gray moss, so we’ll have a very full afternoon.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Professor,” asked Cal, as the man
of science rejoined the group, “are you quite sure
you won’t let us make a bunk for you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;quite sure.”</p>

<p>“Did you catch the fish you wanted to examine,
or did he take to his wings and fly away?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was only my poor little jest. You
didn’t take it seriously, did you?”</p>

<p>Then, interrupting the reply that Cal had begun
to make, he said rapidly:</p>

<p>“But I did want to make another examination
of the fish in question. You see, when I examined
a specimen a few days ago, my attention was concentrated
upon certain definite points, and when I
casually observed something that suggested the possibility
of its having a sense of taste, I went on
with the other questions in my mind and quite forgot
to satisfy myself on this point. But when I
sat down this morning to write notes of my observations,
the point came back to my mind, and I
saw that I must examine another specimen before
writing at all. That is what I meant by saying, in
figurative speech, that my fish went flying away
among the bushes, or whatever else it was that I
said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, Professor,” said Larry, “something you
said about a fish’s sense of taste just now awakens
my curiosity. May I ask you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not now,” said Dick. “Let’s reserve all that
for this evening after supper. You see Tom isn’t
here now, and he will want to hear it all. Maybe
the professor will let us turn loose our tongues to-night
and ask him the dozen questions we have in
our minds.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;a thousand, if you wish,” Dunbar answered.
“I have studied fish with more interest,
perhaps, than I ever felt in investigating any other
subject, and naturally I like to air the results of my
inquiries.”</p>

<p>Larry busied himself taking the dinner from the
fire, and as he did so Tom returned.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tom!” called out Cal as the boy was
struggling through the bushes back of the camp.
“Just in time for dinner. Did you get anything
worth while?”</p>

<p>“Judge for yourself,” he replied, entering the
open space and dropping a huge turkey gobbler on
the ground. “Isn’t that a beauty? Got him on
the wing, too. But I forgot, Cal, you don’t approve
of post-mortem chatter over game. One
thing I must tell you, anyhow. I found a patch of
these and brought home some samples in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
pockets to see if it’s worth while to go after
more.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew out a number of sweet potatoes
and cast them down.</p>

<p>“Are there more to be had?” Larry asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, bushels of them&mdash;growing wild.”</p>

<p>“Good! Tom, you’ve a positive genius for finding
precisely what we want. Our supply of bread
and bread substitutes is very scant, or was before
you made this discovery, and with all due respect
for your opinion, Professor, I am satisfied that we
need a considerable proportion of starchy foods to
go with our meat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I agree with you as to that,” quickly answered
the professor. “I have never doubted it.
I only said that man, being an omnivorous animal,
can live upon an exclusive diet of meat just as he
can live on the starchy foods alone. I think I stated
distinctly that he is better off with both than with
either alone.”</p>

<p>“You certainly did say that, Professor,” said
Dick; “it is only that Larry was inattentive at the
time of your lecture. But I say, Tom, is it far to
your potato patch?”</p>

<p>“Only about half a mile or a little less.”</p>

<p>They were all busily eating dinner now, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
a minute there was nothing more said. Presently
Tom spoke:</p>

<p>“I say, Larry, which of you fellows can best
be spared to go with me after dinner, and help me
bring in the deer?”</p>

<p>“What deer?” asked all in a breath.</p>

<p>“Why, the one I shot an hour or so ago. I
managed to hang him up in a tree out of reach of
other animals, I think, but I suppose he ought to be
brought to camp pretty soon.”</p>

<p>Cal rose threateningly.</p>

<p>“I am strongly tempted to throw things at you,
Tom Garnett,” he began. “But there isn’t anything
to throw except the ax, and if I threw that I
might incapacitate you for walking, and without
your assistance we might not be able to find that
deer. What do you mean, sir, by interrupting us
at dinner with a surprise like that? Don’t you
realize that it is bad for the digestion? In plain
language that even your intelligence can perhaps
grasp, why in the name of all that is sensible, didn’t
you tell us about the thing when you first came?”</p>

<p>“I’ve associated with you, Cal, too long and too
intimately to retain a just appreciation of what is
sensible. Anyhow, I wanted the fun of springing
the thing on you in that way. If you’ve finished
your dinner, we’ll be off after the venison. It
isn’t half a mile away.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXX</h2>

<p class="pch">DUNBAR TALKS AND SLEEPS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> required nearly all the afternoon for Tom and
Cal to bring the deer to camp and dress it. In the
meantime Larry, Dick and Dunbar&mdash;who insisted
upon helping and did his part very cleverly&mdash;worked
upon the shelter and the bunks inside. As
a result the hut was ready for use that night, though
not quite finished in certain details.</p>

<p>By Larry’s orders no further work was to be
done after supper, but supper was to be late, as
there was the turkey to be roasted, and he wanted
to roast it right. While he was preparing the bird
for the fire, Dick was rigging up a vine contrivance
to serve in lieu of a spit, and Tom and Cal employed
the time in bringing a bushel or two of Tom’s wild
sweet potatoes to camp.</p>

<p>The turkey was suspended by a long vine from
the limb of a tree, so hung as to bring the fowl immediately
in front of a fire built at that point especially
for this roasting. Dick had bethought him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
to go to the dory and bring away a square of sheet
copper, carried for boat-repairing purposes. This
he scoured to brightness with sand, after which he
fashioned it into a rude dripping pan, and placed
it under the turkey to catch the juices for basting
purposes. There was nothing remotely resembling
a spoon in the camp or the boat, but Dick was
handy with his jackknife, and it did not take him
long to whittle out a long-handled wooden ladle
with which to do the basting.</p>

<p>By another device of his the roasting fowl was
kept turning as fast or as slowly as might seem
desirable. This device consisted of two very slender
vines attached to the supporting vine at a point
several feet above the fire. One of the “twirlers,”
as Dick called the slender vines, was wrapped several
times around the supporting vine in one direction
and the other in the opposite way.</p>

<p>Sitting on opposite sides of the fire, and each
grasping a “twirler,” Dick and Larry kept the turkey
turning first one way and then the other.</p>

<p>While they were engaged in this, an abundant
supply of Tom’s sweet potatoes were roasting in
the ashes.</p>

<p>“Now we are at Quasi,” said Cal, just before
the turkey was declared “done to a turn”&mdash;“at
Quasi, the object of all our hopes, the goal of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
endeavors, and the guiding star of all our aspirations
during a period of buffetings, trials and sore
afflictions. We are securely at Quasi, and our residence&mdash;which
prosaic people might call a hut,
hovel or shanty, but which is to us a mansion&mdash;is
practically finished. It is only meet and fit, and
in accordance with Homeric custom, that we
should celebrate the occasion and the toilsome
achievements that have made it possible, by all
possible lavishness of feasting. All of which
means that I am going to make a pot of robust and
red-hot coffee to drink with the turkey and
‘taters.’”</p>

<p>It was a hungry company that sat down on the
ground to eat that supper, and if there was anything
lacking in the bill of fare, such appetites as
theirs did not permit the boys to find out the fact.</p>

<p>“It is an inflexible rule of good housewives,”
drawled Cal, when the dinner was done, “that the
‘things’ as they call the dishes, pots, pans, and the
like, shall be cleared away and cleansed. So here
goes,” gathering up the palmete leaves that had
served for plates and tossing them, together with
the bones and fragments of the feast, upon the
fire, where they quickly crackled into nothingness.
“There aren’t any cooking utensils, and as for
these exquisitely shaped agate iron cups, it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
function of each fellow to rinse the coffee out of
his own. Oh, yes, there’s the coffee pot I forgot
it, and by way of impressing the enormity of
my fault upon a dull intelligence I’ll clean that
myself. A hurried scouring with some sand and
water, followed by a thorough rinsing, ought to do
the business finely.”</p>

<p>“I say, Cal,” said Dick, “I wish you would remember
that this is your off night.”</p>

<p>“I confess I don’t understand. Do you mean
that I shall leave the coffee pot for some other member
of the company to scour?”</p>

<p>“No. I mean this is your off night for word-slinging.
The professor is going to tell us some
things and we want to hear him. So, ‘dry up.’”</p>

<p>“I bow my head in contriteness and deep humiliation.
You have the floor, Professor.”</p>

<p>“May I ask you young gentlemen not to call me
‘professor’?” Dunbar asked very earnestly.</p>

<p>“Why, of course, we will do as you like about
that,” answered Larry; “we have been calling you
‘professor’ merely out of respect, and you told
us you were or had been a professor in a college.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, and I thank you for your impulse
of courtesy. I used the word descriptively
when I told you I had been a ‘professor’ of Natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
History. Used in that way it is inoffensive
enough, but when employed as a title&mdash;well, you
know every tight-rope walker and every trapeze
performer calls himself ‘professor.’”</p>

<p>“Well, you must at least have a doctorate of
some kind,” said Dick, “and so you are entitled
to be addressed as ‘Dr. Dunbar.’”</p>

<p>“No, not at all. Of course a number of colleges
have offered me baubles of that cheap sort&mdash;asking
to make me ‘LL.D.,’ or ‘Ph. D.,’ or
‘L. H. D.,’ or some other sham sort of a doctor,
but I have always refused upon principle. I hate
shams, and as to these things, they seem to me to
work a grievous injustice. No man ought to be
called ‘Doctor’ unless he has earned the degree
by a prescribed course of study and examinations.
Honorary degrees are an affront to the men who
have won real degrees by years of hard study.
With two or three hundred colleges in this country,
each scattering honorary degrees around and
multiplying them every year, all degrees have lost
something of their value and significance.”</p>

<p>“How shall we address you then?” asked
Larry.</p>

<p>“Simply as ‘Mr. Dunbar.’ The President of
the United States is entitled to no other address
than ‘Mr. President.’ In a republic certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
‘Mr.’ ought to be title enough for any man. Call
me ‘Mr. Dunbar,’ please.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Mr. Dunbar, won’t you go on and
tell us what you promised?”</p>

<p>“What was it? I have quite forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Why, you said you had been led to suspect
that your fish&mdash;the kind that takes wing and flies
away into the bushes&mdash;had a sense of taste. Did
you mean to imply that fishes generally have no
such sense?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly. There are very few fishes that
have capacity of taste. They have no need of it,
as they bolt their food whole, and usually alive.
There are curious exceptions, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Dunbar,” interrupted Tom, “is it
only because they swallow their food whole that
you think they have no sense of taste? Is there
any more certain way of finding out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. The sense of taste is located
in certain nerves, called for that reason ‘gustatory
nerves,’ or ‘taste goblets.’ Now, as the fishes generally
have no gustatory nerves or taste goblets,
we know positively that they do not and cannot
taste their food. That is definite; but the other
reason I gave is sufficient in itself to settle the
matter. The gustatory nerves cannot taste any
substance until it is partially dissolved and brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
into contact with them in its dissolved state. You
can test that for yourself by placing a dry lump
of sugar in your mouth. Until the saliva begins
to dissolve it you can no more recognize any taste
in it than in a similar lump of marble.”</p>

<p>“But why do they eat so voraciously then?
What pleasure do they find in it?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Chiefly the pleasure of distending the stomach,
but there is also the natural craving of every living
organism for sustenance, without which it must
suffer and die. That craving for sustenance is
ordinarily satisfied only by eating, but it may be
satisfied in other ways. Sometimes a man cannot
swallow because of an obstruction in the canal
by which food reaches the stomach. In such cases
the surgeons insert a tube through the walls of
the body and introduce food directly into the
stomach. That satisfies the desire for sustenance,
though the patient has not tasted anything.
When a fish takes a run and jump at a minnow
and swallows it whole at a gulp, he is doing for
himself much the same thing that the surgeon does
for his patient.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Dunbar,” Tom asked, “why is it then
that the same species of fish will take a particular
kind of bait at one time of year and won’t touch it at
other times? In the very early spring I’ve caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
lots of perch on worms, while a little later they
would take nothing but live bait, and still later,
when they were feeding on insects on the surface,
I’ve known them to nose even live bait out of their
way, refusing to take anything but the insects.
If they don’t taste their food, why do they behave
in that way?”</p>

<p>“Frankly, I don’t know,” Dunbar answered.
“I have formed many conjectures on the subject,
but all of them are unsatisfactory. Perhaps somebody
will solve the riddle some day, but at present
I confess I can’t answer it.”</p>

<p>Dunbar stopped as if he meant to say no more,
and Tom became apologetic.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please go on, Mr. Dunbar? I’m
sorry I interrupted.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you must interrupt. If you don’t interpose
with questions, how am I to know whether
I’ve made my meaning clear or not? And how
am I to know what else you wish to hear? No,
no, no. Don’t withhold any question that comes
into your mind, or I shall feel that I’m making a
bore of myself by talking too much.”</p>

<p>“You spoke,” said Dick, “of certain fishes that
are exceptions to the rule.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; thank you. I meant to come back
to that but forgot it. The chief exception I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
of is the bullhead, a small species of catfish that
abounds in northern waters, particularly in the
Adirondack lakes. The bullhead has gustatory
nerves all over him. He can taste with his tail,
or his side, or his head, as well as with his mouth.
Of course there’s a good reason for the difference.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but I can’t imagine what it is,”
said Larry.</p>

<p>“Neither can I,” echoed Tom and Dick. Cal
continued the silence he had not broken by a word
since Dunbar had begun. Observing the fact,
Dick was troubled lest his playful suppression of
Cal at the beginning had wounded him. So, rising,
he went over to Cal’s side, passed his arm
around him in warm friendly fashion, and said
under his breath:</p>

<p>“Did you take me seriously, Cal? Are you hurt
or offended?”</p>

<p>“No, you sympathetically sublimated idiot, of
course not. It is only that I want to hear all I
can of Mr. Dunbar’s talk. You know I’ve always
been interested in fish&mdash;even when they refuse to
take bait. Hush. He’s about to begin again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is obvious enough when you think about
it,” said Dunbar. “It is a fundamental law of
nature that every living thing, animal or vegetable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
shall tend to develop whatever organs or functions
it has need of, for defense against enemies or for
securing the food it needs. You see that everywhere,
in the coloring of animals and in a thousand
other ways. The upper side of a flounder is
exactly the color of the sand on which he lies.
That is to prevent the shark and other enemies
from seeing him and eating him up. But his under
side, which cannot be seen at all by his enemies,
is white, because there is no need of color in it.
I could give you a hundred illustrations, but there
is no need. Your own daily observation will supply
them.”</p>

<p>Again Dunbar paused, as if his mind had wandered
far away and was occupying itself with other
subjects. After waiting for a minute or two Cal
ventured to jog his memory:</p>

<p>“As we are not familiar with the bullhead&mdash;we
who live down South&mdash;we don’t quite see the
application of what you’ve been saying, Mr. Dunbar.
Would you mind explaining?”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly not,” quickly answered the man
of science, rousing himself as if from sleep. “I
was saying&mdash;it’s very ridiculous, but I’ve quite
forgotten what I was saying. Tell me.”</p>

<p>“You were telling us about the bullhead’s possession&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I remember now. You see fishes generally
hunt their prey by sight, in the clear upper
water and in broad daylight. They quit feeding
as soon as it becomes too dark to see the minnows
or other things they want to eat. As they hunt
only by sight, they have no need of the senses of
smell and taste, and so those senses are not developed
in them. With the bullhead the thing is
exactly turned around. He never swims or feeds
in the upper waters. He lives always on or very
near the bottom of comparatively deep water, in
thick growths of grass, where sight would be of
little use to him for want of light. He feeds almost
entirely at night, so that those who fish for
him rarely begin their sport before the dusk falls.
In such conditions Mr. Bullhead finds it exceedingly
convenient to be able to taste anything he
may happen to touch in his gropings. So with
him the sense of taste is the food-finding sense,
and in the long ages since his species came into
being that sense has been developed out of all proportion
to the others. He has very little feeling
and his nervous system is so rudimentary that if
you leave him in a pail without water and packed
in with a hundred others of his species, he seems
to find very little to distress him in the experience.
You may keep him in the waterless pail for twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
hours or more, and yet if you put him back
into the pond or lake he will swim away as unconcernedly
as if nothing out of the ordinary had
happened. But then all species of fish are among
the very lowest forms of vertebrate creatures, so
that they feel neither pain nor pleasure at all
keenly.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Dunbar ceased speaking for a minute.
Then he seemed to speak with some effort, saying:</p>

<p>“There are many other things I could tell you
about fish, and if you’re interested, I’ll do so at
another time. I’m very sleepy now. May I pass
the night here?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I’ll bring you some moss&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It isn’t at all necessary,” he answered, as he
threw himself flat upon the earth and fell instantly
into a slumber so profound that it lasted until Cal
called him to breakfast next morning.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XXXI</h2>

<p class="pch">DUNBAR’S STRANGE BEHAVIOR</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunbar</span> was very silent during breakfast. He
answered courteously when spoken to, as he always
did, and there was no suggestion of surliness
in his silence. In response to inquiries he declared
that he had slept well and hoped the boys had done
the same. But he added no unnecessary word to
anything he said, and made no inquiries as to
plans for the day. His manner was that of a person
suffering under grief or apprehension or both.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over he started off
into the woods in a direction opposite to that in
which his camp lay. He took neither his rifle nor
his butterfly net with him. He simply walked
into the woodlands and disappeared.</p>

<p>At dinner time he was nowhere to be found.
As evening drew near the boys agreed to postpone
their supper to a later hour than usual in anticipation
of his return. But late as it was when at
last they sat down to their evening meal, he was
still missing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys were beginning to be alarmed about
him, for they had already learned to like the man
and regard him as a friend.</p>

<p>“We must do something at once,” suggested
Dick.</p>

<p>“But what can we do?” asked Larry. “I confess
I can think of few possibilities in the way of
searching for him at this time of a very dark night&mdash;for
the clouds completely shut out the moonlight.
Has anybody a suggestion to offer? What
say you, Cal?”</p>

<p>“First of all,” was the reply, “we must carefully
consider all the possibilities of the situation.
Then we shall be better able to lay plans of rescue
that may result in something. Let’s see. To begin
with, he hasn’t left Quasi. He hasn’t any boat
and there is absolutely no land communication with
the main. So he is somewhere on Quasi plantation.</p>

<p>“Secondly, what can have happened to him?
Not many things that I can think of. Old woods
wanderer that he is, it isn’t likely that he has succumbed
to any woodland danger, if there are any
such dangers here, as there aren’t. There isn’t any
wild beast here more threatening than a deer or a
’possum. He had no gun with him, so he cannot
have shot himself by accident. He may have got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
lost, but that is exceedingly unlikely. He is used
to finding his way in the woods, and it is certain
that he thoroughly explored Quasi during the time
he was marooned here and flying his distress signal.
If by any possible chance he is lost, he’ll soon
find himself again. The only other thing I think
of is that he may have tripped and fallen, breaking
something.”</p>

<p>“I should doubt his doing that,” said Larry,
“for he’s as nimble as any cat I ever saw. Still,
there’s the chance. What shall we do to meet
it?”</p>

<p>“We can’t scatter out and search the woods and
thickets in the dark,” suggested Dick.</p>

<p>“No,” said Tom; “if we did he would have to
go in search of four other lost fellows if he should
happen to turn up. But we can keep up a big fire
and we can go out a little way into the woods, fire
our shotguns, give all the college yells we know,
and then listen.”</p>

<p>“Good suggestion, that about shooting and yelling,”
said Cal. “Besides, I like to yell on general
principles. But we shan’t need to keep up a bonfire,
and the night is very hot.”</p>

<p>“But he might see the bonfire,” answered Tom
in defense of his plan, “and he’d come straight to
it, of course, if he’s lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll put up something else that he can see
farther and better.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“A fat pine torch.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Did you observe a catalpa tree that stands all
alone over there on the highest part of the bluff,
which is also the highest point in the whole land
of Quasi?”</p>

<p>“Of course, if you mean over there, near the
<i>Hunkydory’s</i> anchorage.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I mean that. There isn’t another tree
anywhere near it. I can’t imagine how it came to
grow out there on that bald bluff, unless somebody
planted it. However, that’s no matter. The tree
is there and a torch fixed in the top of it could be
seen from almost every nook and corner of Quasi,
while here we are in a pocket of trees and thick
growths of every kind. A bonfire here could be
seen a very little way off.”</p>

<p>Cal’s modification of Tom’s plan was promptly
approved as the best possible for that night. The
company went into the woods, pausing at several
points to fire their guns and to yell like demons.</p>

<p>No results following, they returned and set to
work making huge torches of fat pine, one of which
was kept burning in the tree-top throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
night, a fresh one being lighted whenever an old
one burned out.</p>

<p>It was all to no purpose. Morning came and
still there was no sign of Dunbar.</p>

<p>Breakfast was cooked and eaten, together with a
reserve supply of food for the boys to carry with
them on the search of the plantation, which they
had decided to make that day. Still no sign of the
missing man!</p>

<p>“Now, Cal,” said Larry, “this thing is becoming
serious. We must find poor Mr. Dunbar to-day
whatever else happens. We must scour the place
till we accomplish that. We must scatter, but we
must see to it that we get together again. Suppose
you suggest a plan of procedure. You’re better
than any of us at that.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Cal, who had lost all disposition
to be facetious. “He may be along the shore
somewhere, so two of us had better follow the sealine,
one going one way and the other in the opposite
direction. They can cover double ground by
going through the woods and open glades, only
keeping near enough the shore to see it well. The
other two will need no directions. Their duty will
be to search the woods and thickets. Where the
woods are open they can cover the ground rapidly,
and also in the old fields wherever they haven’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
grown up too thickly. But the denser woods and
canebrakes must be searched. Look particularly
for trails. No one can possibly pass into or through
such growths without leaving a trail behind. Look
for trails and follow them; don’t bother about the
unbroken growths. Now as to getting back here.
We must all come back well before nightfall. No
matter where we may be on Quasi, it will be easy
to find some point near from which the lone catalpa
tree can be seen. Make for that all of you and
nobody will get lost. Finally, if any of you find
Mr. Dunbar and need help, fire three shots about
half a minute apart and we’ll all go to the point of
firing. Now let’s be off.”</p>

<p>It was nearly sunset when Tom reached the
catalpa tree on his return. He had not found Dunbar,
but for reasons of his own he waited rather
impatiently for the coming of his comrades. They
were not long delayed, but the blank, anxious face
of each as he appeared was a sufficient report to
the others.</p>

<p>“The search is a failure!” said Larry, dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” answered Cal.</p>

<p>“No, not absolutely,” said Tom, feeling in his
pocket. “I found something, and I’ve waited till
you should all be here before speaking of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it? Tell us quick.”</p>

<p>“This,” answered Tom, drawing forth a letter,
“and this,” producing a pruning knife with a curved
blade, which they had all seen Dunbar use. “The
letter was pinned to a tree with the point of the
knife blade.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” said Larry, impatiently;
“read the letter.”</p>

<p>Tom read as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I expect to be with you young gentlemen very soon. But
in case I never see you again, please don’t think me ungrateful
for all your kindnesses. There are times when I cannot endure
a human presence&mdash;even the&mdash;”</p>

<p class="p1">Tom stopped reading, and explained:</p>

<p>“It breaks off right there, and there is no signature,
or address, or anything else.”</p>

<p>The boys stared at each other in amazement, and
for a time uttered no word. When they begun
talking again it was only to wonder and offer conjectures,
and the conjectures seemed so futile that
at last the little company ceased to try to read the
riddle. Then Larry said:</p>

<p>“Come on. There’s nothing more to be done to-night
and we’re all half famished. We must have
a good hearty supper, and then perhaps we’ll think
of something more that we can do.”</p>

<p>“I doubt that,” said Cal; “but I say, Tom, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
have a positive genius for finding things&mdash;turtles’
eggs, smugglers’ camps, sweet potato patches, letters
hidden in the woods, and everything else. Perhaps
you’ll find poor Mr. Dunbar yet.”</p>

<p>“I was just thinking of some other things that
we ought to find, and that right away.”</p>

<p>“What things?”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Dunbar’s. You know he has never
brought any of them to our camp, and we know
he writes and draws and all that. He must have
some place up near his old bivouac where he can
keep his papers and drawings and specimens dry.
It seems to me we ought&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course we ought,” broke in Cal. “There
may be something there to give us a clue. What
do you say, Larry?”</p>

<p>“It is a good suggestion of Tom’s, and we’ll act
upon it at once.”</p>

<p>Turning in a direction opposite to that which led
to their own camp the boys visited the spot where
Dunbar had lived before they came to Quasi. They
searched in every direction, but found no trace of
any of the man’s belongings. It was rapidly growing
dark when at last they gave up the work of exploring,
and decided to resume it again in the
morning.</p>

<p>As they approached their camp through the woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and thickets, they were surprised to see their camp-fire
blazing up briskly, though none of them had
been near it since the early morning. As they came
out of the bushes, they were still more astonished
to see Dunbar busying himself with supper preparations.
Larry had just time enough before Dunbar
saw them to say to the others in an undertone:</p>

<p>“Not a word about this, boys, until he asks.”</p>

<p>“Good evening, young gentlemen,” was Dunbar’s
greeting, delivered in a cheery voice; “I have
taken the liberty of getting supper under way in
anticipation of your coming. I am sure you must
be tired and hungry after a hard day’s shooting.
By the way, a cup of tea is always refreshing when
one is tired, and fortunately I have a little packet
of the fragrant herb among my things. I’ll run up
there and fetch it.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he started off briskly and nimbly.</p>

<p>“Evidently he isn’t tired, anyhow,” suggested
Dick.</p>

<p>“And evidently he has some dry place in which
to keep his things,” added Cal, “and I mean to ask
him about it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” said Larry, earnestly. “That would
be grossly impertinent.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, if it’s done in the proper way,” Cal
replied, “and I’ll do it in that way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>And he did. When Dunbar returned, he carried
the tea, closely sealed up in tin foil.</p>

<p>“Is that thin tin foil sufficient to keep tea dry?”
Cal asked.</p>

<p>“If you keep the packet in a dry place it is,” Dunbar
answered. “The tin-foil prevents the delicate
aroma of the tea from escaping, and at the same
time forbids the leaves to absorb moisture from the
air. When I’m moving about in a boat I carefully
wrap any tea I may have in my waterproof sheets,
but that is apt to give it an undesirable flavor, so
my first care upon landing is to provide a dry storage
place for my tea, my ammunition, my papers
and whatever else I may have that needs protection.
By the way, I’ve never shown you my locker up
there. I’ll do so to-morrow morning. I’ll not forget,
as I must go there for writing and drawing
materials. I have some things in my mind that I
simply must put down on paper at once.”</p>

<p>At that moment he thrust his hand into his pocket
and felt there for some seconds. Then he said:</p>

<p>“That’s very unfortunate. I’ve managed to lose
my knife.”</p>

<p>“I think I must have found it, then,” said Tom,
holding it out; “isn’t that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you. I’m particularly glad to get
it again, as it is the only one I have at Quasi. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
usually buy half a dozen at a time, and so the loss
of one doesn’t annoy me. But just now I have only
this one.”</p>

<p>He did not ask where or when Tom had found
the knife, nor did he seem in the least surprised
that it was found. The circumstance did not seem
to remind him of his letter or of anything else.</p>

<p>The boys were full of wonder and curiosity, but
they asked no questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunbar</span> was in excellent spirits that evening.
He seemed indeed like one who has had some specially
good fortune happen to him, or one suddenly
relieved of some distress or sore annoyance.</p>

<p>Throughout the evening he talked with the boys
in a way that greatly interested them. He made
no display of learning, but they easily discovered
that his information was both vast and varied, and
better still, that his thinking was sound, and that
he was a master of the art of so presenting his
thought that others easily grasped and appreciated
it.</p>

<p>When at last the evening was completely gone,
he bade his companions a cheery good night, saying
that he would go over to the bluff and sleep
near the catalpa tree.</p>

<p>“You see there are no sand flies to-night,” he explained,
“and I like to smell the salt water as I
sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you make of him, Larry?” Dick asked
as soon as their guest was beyond hearing.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’m puzzled. What’s your opinion?”</p>

<p>“Put it in the plural, for I’ve a different opinion
every time I think about it at all.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” said Tom, “he must be crazy. Just
think&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted Cal, “but just think also how
soundly he thinks. Let’s just call him eccentric
and let it go at that. And who wouldn’t be eccentric,
after living alone in the woods for so
long?”</p>

<p>“After all,” Dick responded, “we’re not a commission
in lunacy, and we’re not under the smallest
necessity of defining his mental condition.”</p>

<p>“No,” Cal assented; “it’s a good deal better to
enjoy his company and his talk than to bother our
heads about the condition of his. He’s one of the
most agreeable men I ever met&mdash;bright, cheerful,
good natured, scrupulously courteous, and about the
most interesting talker I ever listened to. So I for
one give up trying to answer conundrums, and I’m
going to bed. I wouldn’t if he were here to go on
talking, but after an evening with him to lead the
conversation, I find you fellows dull and uninteresting.
Good night. Oh, by the way, I’ll slip away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
from here about daylight and get some pan fish for
breakfast.”</p>

<p>Early as Cal was in setting out, he found Dunbar
on the shore ready to go with him.</p>

<p>“I hope to get a shark,” the naturalist said, “one
big enough to show a well-developed jaw, and
they’re apt to bite at this early hour. I’ve a line in
the boat there with a copper wire snell.”</p>

<p>“Are you specially interested in sharks?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not ordinarily. It is only that I must
make a careful drawing or two, illustrative of the
mechanical structure and action of a shark’s jaw
and teeth, to go with an article I’m writing on the
general subject of teeth in fishes, and I wish to
draw the illustrations from life rather than from
memory. It will rain to-day, and I’m going to avail
myself of your hospitality and make the drawings
under your shelter.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps you’ll let us see them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, and all the other drawings I
have in my portfolio, if they interest you.”</p>

<p>“They will, if you will explain and expound a
little.”</p>

<p>Dunbar gave a pleased little chuckle as he answered:</p>

<p>“I’ll do that to your heart’s content. You know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
I really think I like to hear myself talk sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t you? Your talk would delight
anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Here’s my shark,” excitedly cried Dunbar, as
he played the fish. “He’s nearly three feet long,
too&mdash;a bigger one than I hoped for. Now if I can
only land him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you,” said Cal, leaning over the rail
with a barbed gaff hook in his hand. “Play him
over this way&mdash;there, now once more around&mdash;here
he is safe and sound.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he lifted the savage-looking creature
into the boat and Dunbar managed, with some little
difficulty, to free the hook from his jaws without
himself having a thumb or finger bitten off.</p>

<p>“Not a tooth broken!” he exclaimed with delight.
“I’ll dissect out the entire bony structure
of the head to-day and make a drawing of it. Then
I’m going to pack it carefully in a little box that
I’ll whittle out, and present it&mdash;if you don’t mind&mdash;to
young Wentworth. He may perhaps value it
as a souvenir of his visit to Quasi.”</p>

<p>Cal assented more than gladly, and the two busied
themselves during the next half hour completing
their catch of whiting and croakers for breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
When they reached the camp the rain Dunbar had
predicted had set in.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over Dunbar redeemed
his promise to show the boys his lockers.</p>

<p>“I’m going over there now,” he said, “to get
some paper, pencils and drawing board. Suppose
you go with me, if you want to see some of my
woodland devices.”</p>

<p>They assented gladly. They were very curious
to see where and how their guest cared for his perishable
properties, the more because their own
search for the lockers had completely failed.</p>

<p>The matter proved simple enough. Dunbar led
them a little way into the woods and then, falling
upon his knees, crawled into the end of a huge hollow
log. After he had reached the farther end of
the hollow part he lighted a little bunch of fat
pine splinters to serve as a torch, and invited his
companions to look in. They saw that he had
scraped away all the decaying wood inside the log,
leaving its hard shell as a bare wall. In this he had
fitted a number of little wooden hooks, to each of
which some of his belongings were suspended.</p>

<p>It was a curious collection. There were cards
covered with butterflies, moths and beetles, each impaled
upon a large pin. There were the beaks and
talons of various birds of prey, each carefully labeled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
There were bunches of feathers of various
hues, some dried botanical specimens and much else
of similar sorts.</p>

<p>From the farther end of the hollow he brought
forth several compact little portfolios, each so arranged
that no rain could penetrate it when all
were bound together and carried like a knapsack.</p>

<p>“I’ll take two of these portfolios with me to your
shelter,” he said, taking them under his arm. “One
of them contains the writing and drawing materials
that I shall need to-day. The other is filled with
my drawings of various interesting objects. Some
of them may be interesting to you during this rainy
day, and each has a description appended which will
enable you to understand the meaning of it.”</p>

<p>But the boys had a rather brief time over the
drawings that day. They ran through a part of the
portfolio while Dunbar was writing, but after an
hour he put his writing aside and began dissecting
the shark’s head, stopping now and then to make a
little sketch of some detail. After that the boys
had no eyes but for the work he was doing and no
ears but for the things he said.</p>

<p>“You see there are comparatively few species of
fish that have any teeth at all. They have no need
of teeth and therefore have never developed them.”</p>

<p>“But why is that,” asked Tom; “I should think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
some of the toothless varieties of fish would have
developed teeth accidentally, as it were.”</p>

<p>“Development is never accidental in that sense,
Tom. It is Nature’s uniform law that every species
of living thing, animal or vegetable, shall tend to
develop whatever is useful to it, and nothing else.
That is Nature’s plan for the perpetuation of life
and the improvement of species.”</p>

<p>After pausing in close attention to some detail of
his work, Dunbar went on:</p>

<p>“You can see the same dominant principle at
work in the varying forms of teeth developed by
different species. The sheepshead needs teeth only
for the purpose of crushing the shells of barnacles
and the like, and in that way getting at its food.
So in a sheepshead’s mouth you find none but
crushing teeth. The shark, as you see, has pointed
teeth so arranged in rows that one row closes down
between two other rows in the opposite jaw, and
by a muscular arrangement the shark can work one
jaw to right and left with lightning-like rapidity,
making the saw-like row of teeth cut through almost
anything after the manner of a reaping machine.
Then there is the pike. He has teeth altogether
different from either of the others. The
pike swallows very large fish in proportion to his
own size, and his need is of teeth that will prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
his prey from wriggling out of his mouth and escaping
while he is slowly trying to swallow it. Accordingly
his teeth are as small and as sharp as
cambric needles. Moreover, he has them everywhere
in his mouth&mdash;on his lips, on his tongue,
and even in his throat. However, this is no time
for a lecture. If you are interested in the subject
you can study it better by looking into fishes’
mouths than by listening to anybody talk or by
reading books on the subject.”</p>

<p>Again Dunbar paused in order that his attention
might be closely concentrated upon some delicate
detail of his work.</p>

<p>When the strain upon his attention seemed at
last to relax, Cal ventured to say something&mdash;and
it was startling to his comrades.</p>

<p>“Of course you’re right about the books on such
subjects,” he said. “For example, the most interesting
of all facts about fish isn’t so much as mentioned
in any book I can find, though I’ve searched
through several libraries for it.”</p>

<p>“What is your fact?” asked Dunbar, suspending
his work to listen.</p>

<p>“Why that fish do not die natural deaths. Not
one of them in a million ever does that.”</p>

<p>“But why do you think that, Cal? What proof
is there&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, the thing’s obvious on its face. A dead
fish floats, doesn’t it? Well, in any good fishing
water, such as the Adirondack lakes, where I fished
with my father one summer, there are millions of
fish&mdash;big and little&mdash;scores of millions, even hundreds
of millions, if you count shiners and the other
minnows, that of a clear day lie in banks from the
bottom of the water to its surface. Now, if fish
died natural deaths in anything like the proportion
that all other living things do, the surface of such
lakes would be constantly covered with dead fish.
Right here at Quasi and in all these coast waters
the same thing is true. Every creek mouth is full
of fish and every shoal is alive with them, so that
we know in advance when we go fishing that we
can catch them as fast as we can take them off the
hook. If any reasonable rate of natural mortality
prevailed among them every flood tide would strew
the shores with tons of dead fish. As nothing of
the kind happens, it seems to me certain that as a
rule fish do not die a natural death. In fact, most
of them have no chance to do that, as they spend
pretty nearly their entire time in swallowing each
other alive.”</p>

<p>“You are a close observer, Cal. You ought to
become a man of science,” said Dunbar with enthusiasm.
“Science needs men of your kind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered Cal. “I imagine
Science can get on very comfortably without any
help of mine.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to notice all that, anyhow,
Cal?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, it didn’t take much to suggest that sort of
thing, when the facts were staring me in the face.
Besides, I may be all wrong. What do you think
of my wild guess, Mr. Dunbar?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a wild guess. Your conclusion may be
right or wrong&mdash;I must think of the subject carefully
before I can form any opinion as to that. But
at any rate it is a conclusion reasoned out from a
careful observation of facts, and that is nothing
like a wild guess.”</p>

<p>Thus the conversation drifted on throughout the
long rainy day, and when night came the boys were
agreed that they had learned to know Dunbar and
appreciate him more than they could have done in
weeks of ordinary intercourse.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">A GREAT CATASTROPHE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the next fortnight or so the association
between Dunbar and the boys was intimate and
constant. When it rained, so that outdoor expeditions
were not inviting, he toiled diligently at his
writing and drawing, keeping up an interesting conversation
in the meanwhile on all manner of subjects.
In the evenings especially the talk around the
fire was entertaining to the boys and Dunbar seemed
to enjoy it as much as they. He was fond of
“drawing them out” and listening to such revelations
of personal character and capacity as their unrestrained
discussions gave.</p>

<p>On fine days he made himself one of them, joining
heartily in every task and enthusiastically sharing
every sport afloat or afield. He was a good,
strong oarsman and he could sail a boat as well as
even Dick could. In hunting, his woodcraft was
wonderfully ingenious, and among other things he
taught the boys a dozen ways of securing game
by trapping and snaring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>“You see,” he explained, “one is liable sometimes
to be caught in the woods without his gun
or without ammunition, and when that happens it is
handy to know how to get game enough to eat in
other ways than by shooting.”</p>

<p>During all this time he had no more of his strange
moods. He never once fell into the peculiar slumber
the boys had observed before, and he never absented
himself from the company. Indeed, his enjoyment
of human association seemed to be more
than ordinarily keen.</p>

<p>Little by little his comrades let the memory of
his former eccentricity fade out of their minds, or
if they thought of it at all they dismissed it as a
thing of no significance, due, doubtless, to habitual
living in solitude.</p>

<p>One rainy afternoon he suddenly turned to the
boys and asked:</p>

<p>“Does any one of you happen to know what day
of the month this is? By my count it must be
somewhere about the twenty-fifth of August.”</p>

<p>“My little calendar,” said Cal, drawing the card
from a pocket and looking at it attentively for a
moment, “takes the liberty of differing with you in
opinion, Mr. Dunbar. It insists that this is the
thirty-first day of August, of the year eighteen hundred
and eighty-six.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Dunbar almost leaped to his feet in surprise. After
a brief period of thought he turned to Larry and
asked:</p>

<p>“I wonder if you boys would mind sailing with
me over to the nearest postoffice town early to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“Why, you know, Mr. Dunbar,” Larry answered,
“to-morrow morning is mortgaged. We’re all
going out after that deer you’ve located. Won’t
the next day answer just as well for your trip?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, no. I gave my word that I
would post certain writings and drawings to the
publisher not later than noon on September 1, and
the printers simply must not be kept waiting. Of
course, if you can’t&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But we can and will,” answered Larry. “Your
business is important&mdash;the deer hunt is of no consequence.
But you’ll come back with us, will you
not?”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to do so if I may,” he answered.
“I’m enjoying it here with you, and my
work never before got on so well with so little toil
over it. I shall like to come back with you and stay
at Quasi as long as you boys do.”</p>

<p>“That’s good news&mdash;altogether good. How
long are you likely to be detained at the village?”</p>

<p>“Only long enough to post my letter and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
manuscript&mdash;not more than half an hour at the
most.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. We shall want to buy all the
bread and that sort of thing there is to be had over
there, but we can easily do that within your half
hour. We’ll start about sunrise, and if the wind
favors us we’ll be back by noon or a little later, and
even if we have no wind, the oars will bring us
back before nightfall.”</p>

<p>Dunbar at once set to work to arrange and pack
the drawings he wished to send by mail, and as
there were titles to write and explanatory paragraphs
to revise, the work occupied him until supper
time. In the meanwhile the boys prepared the
boat, filled the water kegs, bestowed a supply of
fishing tackle, and overhauled the rigging to see
that every rope was clear and every pulley in free
running order.</p>

<p>After supper there was not a very long evening
for talk around the fire, for, with an early morning
start in view, they must go early to their bunks.</p>

<p>They all rolled themselves in their blankets about
nine o’clock and soon were sleeping soundly&mdash;the
boys under the shelter and Dunbar under the starry
sky&mdash;for the rain had passed away&mdash;by that side
of the fire which was opposite the camp hut.</p>

<p>Their slumber had not lasted for an hour when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
suddenly they were awakened by a combination of
disturbances amply sufficient, as Dick afterwards
said, “to waken the denizens of a cemetery.”</p>

<p>The very earth was swaying under them and
rocking back and forth like a boat lying side on to a
swell. Deep down&mdash;miles beneath the surface it
seemed, there was a roar which sounded to Cal like
“forty thousand loose-jointed wagons pulled by
runaway horses across a rheumatic bridge.”</p>

<p>As the boys sprang to their feet they found difficulty
in standing erect, and before they could run
out of their shelter, it plunged forward and fell
into the fire, where the now dried palmete leaves
which constituted its roof and walls, and the resinous
pine poles of its framework, instantly blazed
up in a fierce, crackling flame.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried Dunbar, as Larry, Dick and Cal
extricated themselves from the mass, “quick&mdash;help
here! Tom is entangled in the ruins.”</p>

<p>The response was instantaneous, and before the
rapidly-spreading flames could reach him, the other
four had literally dragged their comrade from the
confused mass of poles and vines in which he had
been imprisoned. If the work of rescue had been
prolonged for even a minute more, it would have
been too late, and Tom would have been burned to
a crisp. As it was, he was choking with smoke,
coughing with a violence that threatened the rupture
of his breathing apparatus somewhere, and
so nearly smothered for want of air as to be only
half conscious.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-341.jpg" width="400" height="612" id="i320"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc"><span class="smcap">A minute more, it would have been too late</span>.<br /><span class="wn"><i>Page 320.</i></span></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>A bucket of water which Dunbar had dashed over
him “set him going again,” as he afterwards described
the process of recovering breath and consciousness,
and as the paroxysms of coughing slowly
ceased he stood erect by way of announcing a recovery
which he was still unable to proclaim in
words.</p>

<p>At that moment a second shock of earthquake
occurred, a shock less violent than the first, but sufficient
to topple Tom and Larry off their feet again.</p>

<p>It did no harm, chiefly because there was no
further harm to do, and the little company busied
themselves saving what they could of their belongings
from the burning ruins.</p>

<p>After they had worked at this for ten minutes, a
third shock came. It was feebler than either of the
others, but just as the boys felt the earth swaying
again there was an explosion under the burning
mass, followed by a rapid succession of smaller explosions
which scattered shot about in a way so
dangerous that at Cal’s command all the company
threw themselves prone upon the ground.</p>

<p>This lasted for perhaps a minute, and fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
nobody received a charge of shot in his person from
the bursting cartridges that had made the racket.
Fortunately, too, the box of cartridges thus caught
in the flames and destroyed was the only one involved
in the catastrophe. The rest had been kept,
not in the hut, but in the <i>Hunkydory’s</i> lockers.</p>

<p>But when they came to take account of their
losses, which they did as soon as the first excitement
had passed away, they found that the damage
done had been considerable.</p>

<p>For one thing, their entire supply of meat was
destroyed; so was their bread and their coffee.</p>

<p>“We shall not starve, anyhow,” Cal decided.
“We can kill as much game as we need and as the
bottom doesn’t seem to have dropped out of the sea,
we can still catch fish, oysters, shrimps and crabs.
As for bread, we still have Tom’s sweet potato
patch to draw upon. There wasn’t more than a
pound of coffee left, so that’s no great loss.”</p>

<p>For the rest, the very few clothes the boys had
brought with them in addition to what they wore,
were all lost, but they decided that they could get
on without them&mdash;“Mr. Dunbar’s fashion.” Tom
was the worst sufferer in that respect, as the garments
he wore had been badly torn in his rescue
from the fire, but he cheerfully announced:</p>

<p>“I can manage very well. I’ll decline all dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
dance and other invitations that require a
change from every-day dress. I’ll have some cards
engraved announcing that ‘Mr. Thomas Garnett
is detained at the South and will not be at home
to receive his friends until further notice.’ Then
I’ll borrow some of your beetle-detaining pins, Mr.
Dunbar, and pin up the worst of the rents in my
trousers.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do better than that, Tom,” the naturalist
answered. “I’ve quite a little sewing kit tucked
away in my log locker. You shall have needles,
thread and a thimble whenever you wish to use
them.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Dunbar; but please spare me
the thimble. I never could use a contrivance of
that kind. Every time I have tried I have succeeded
only in driving the needle into my hand and
breaking it off well beneath the skin.”</p>

<p>“Boy like,” answered Dunbar. “You’re the
victim of a traditional defect in our system of education.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind explaining?” asked Cal.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. I hold that the education of
every human being ought to include a reasonable
mastery of all the simple arts that one is likely to
find useful in emergencies. We do not expect girls
to become accountants, as a rule, but we do not on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
that account leave the multiplication table out of a
girl’s school studies. In the same way we do not
expect boys generally to do much sewing when they
grow to manhood, but as every man is liable to meet
emergencies in which a little skill in the use of
needle, thread and scissors may make all the difference
between comfort and discomfort, every boy
ought to be taught plain sewing. However, we
have other things to think of just now.”</p>

<p>“Indeed we have,” answered Cal, “and the most
pressing one of those other things is to-morrow
morning’s breakfast. Does it occur to any of you
that, except the salt in the dory’s locker, we haven’t
an ounce of food of any kind in our possession?”</p>

<p>“That is so,” “I hadn’t thought of that;” “and
we’ll all be hungry, too, for of course we shall not
sleep”&mdash;these were the responses that came quickly
in answer to Cal’s suggestion.</p>

<p>“We’ll manage the matter in this way,” said Cal,
quite as if no one else had spoken. “When ’yon
grey streaks that fret the clouds give indication of
the dawn,’ Mr. Dunbar will go fishing. As soon as
it grows light enough for you to walk through the
woods without breaking more than two or three
necks apiece, the rest of you can take that big piece
of tarpaulin, go out to Tom’s potato patch, and
bring back a large supply of sweet potatoes. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
breakfast one or two of us can go for some game,
while the rest repair damages here. It will take two
or three days to do that.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he looked about him as if to estimate
the extent of the harm done.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he cried out a moment later. “That’s
bad, very bad.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Cal?”</p>

<p>“Why, our well has completely disappeared&mdash;filled
up to the level by the surrounding earth, which
seems to have lost its head and in that way got
itself ‘into a hole,’ just as people do when they forget
discretion. That means that we’ve got to dig
out the well to-day, and in the meantime drink that
stuff from the spring down under the bluff. Our
day’s work is cut out for us, sure enough.”</p>

<p>Tom had disappeared in the darkness while Cal
was speaking, and as Cal continued to speak for
a considerable time afterwards, marking out what
Dick called a “programme of convenience,” he had
not finished when Tom returned and in breathless
excitement announced that the spring under the bluff
was no more.</p>

<p>“The whole of that part of the bluff has slumped
down to the beach,” he said, “and even the big
catalpa tree is uprooted and overturned. Of course
the spring is completely filled up, and we’ll all be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
half famished for water before we get the well dug
out again.”</p>

<p>“Don’t indulge in too hopeless a grief over the
loss of the spring, Tom,” said Cal in his most confidently
optimistic tone. “We can make another
just as good anywhere down there in half an hour
or less. That puddle held nothing but sea water
that had leaked through the sand, partly filtering
itself in doing so. We can dig a little hole anywhere
down that way, and if we choose the right
sort of place we’ll get better water than the spring
ever yielded. I’ll look after that when Mr. Dunbar
and I go fishing. We’ll have the sand out of this
well by noon, too&mdash;it’s very loose and easily handled.”</p>

<p>“But, Cal,” interrupted Tom; “we haven’t a
thing to dig with. The two shovels we had were in
the hut.”</p>

<p>The others stood aghast; Cal faced the situation
with hopeful confidence.</p>

<p>“That’s bad,” he commented. “Of course the
handles are burned up, but the iron part remains,
and even with the meagre supply of cutting tools we
have&mdash;which is to say our jackknives and the little
ax&mdash;we can fashion new ones. It will take
valuable time, but we must reconcile ourselves to
that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we must get to work at something&mdash;it’s
hard to know where to begin,” said Larry in a
despondent tone. “What’s the first thing to be
done, Cal?”</p>

<p>“The first thing to be done is to cheer up; the
next thing is to stay cheered up. You fellows are
in the dumps worse than the well is, and you’ve got
to get out of them if you have to lift yourselves out
by the straps of your own boots. What’s the matter
with you, anyhow? Have we lived a life of easy
luxury here at Quasi for so long that you’ve forgotten
that this is an expedition in search of sport
and adventure? Isn’t this earthquake overthrow an
adventure of the liveliest sort? Isn’t the loss of
our belongings by fire a particularly adventurous
happening?”</p>

<p>“After all,” broke in Tom, who had a genuine
relish for danger, difficulty and hardship, “after
all, we’re not in half as bad a situation as we were
when we faced the revenue officers from behind our
log breastwork. Our lives were really in danger
then, while now we have nothing worse than difficulty
to face.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a few months hence we’ll all remember
this thing with joy and talk of it with glee.”</p>

<p>“You’re right about that,” said Dunbar, “and it
is always so. I have gone through many trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
experiences, and as I recall them the most severely
trying of them are the ones I remember with the
greatest pleasure. Besides, in this case the way of
escape, even from such difficulties as lie before you,
is wide open. The dory is at anchor down there
and if you are so minded you can sail away from
it all.”</p>

<p>“What! Turn tail and run!” exclaimed Tom,
almost indignantly.</p>

<p>“No, we’re not thinking of that,” said Cal.
“We’ll see the thing out, and, by the way, it’s growing
daylight. Come, Mr. Dunbar! We have a
pressing engagement with the fish and we must have
an early breakfast this morning on all accounts.
We have a lot to do, and you mustn’t be later than
noon in reaching the postoffice, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve abandoned that,” responded Dunbar.</p>

<p>“But why?” asked Larry. “Of course we can’t
go with you as we planned, but you can take the
dory and make the trip for yourself. And perhaps
you won’t mind taking some money along and buying
out whatever food supplies the country store
over there can furnish. We need bread especially,
and coffee and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And a few pounds of cheese won’t come amiss,”
added Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I tell you I am not going,” said Dunbar.
“I have accepted and enjoyed your hospitality when
all was going well with you; do you suppose I’m
going to abandon you even for a day, now that
you’re in trouble and need all the help you can get?”</p>

<p>“Your reasoning is excellent,” said Cal, purposely
lapsing into his old habit of elaborate
speech, by way of relieving the tension that had
made his comrades feel hurried and harassed;
“your reasoning is excellent, but your premises
are utterly wrong. You can help us mightily by
sailing up to that postoffice town and bringing back
the supplies we need, while you cannot help us at
all by remaining here. We four are more than
enough to keep the few tools we have left constantly
busy. With a fifth person included in the
construction gang, there would always be one of us
who must idly hold his hands for want of anything
to work with. No, Mr. Dunbar, the best service
you can render to the common cause is to sail up to
the village, redeem your promise by mailing your
papers, and bring back all you can of provisions
adapted to our use. So that’s settled, isn’t it,
boys?”</p>

<p>Their answer left no room for further argument,
and as the daylight was steadily growing stronger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the party separated, Cal and Dunbar going in
quest of fish for breakfast, and the others struggling
through tangled thickets toward the wild
sweet potato field.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">MAROONED AT QUASI</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a bright, sunny day that followed&mdash;a
day offering no suggestion of the convulsion of the
night before. There was a good sailing breeze
blowing in from the sea. It gave Dunbar the wind
over the starboard quarter for his voyage to the
village, and promised to be nearly abeam for his
return.</p>

<p>“The dory will take me there and back by noon
or a little later,” he called to the others as the sails
filled and the boat heeled over to port.</p>

<p>The Rutledge boys had urged him to take the
money they offered him for the purchase of supplies,
but he had declined.</p>

<p>“I have a plenty of my own,” was his answer,
“and whatever I can buy up there I’ll bring back
as my contribution to the general welfare.”</p>

<p>It was idle to argue the matter, and not very
safe either, Dick thought, for in their intercourse
with him the boys had learned that with all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
kindly good-nature, Dunbar was exceedingly proud
and very sensitive.</p>

<p>When the dory had gone, the boys set to work
with a will upon the task of re-establishing Camp
Quasi. Tom was sent out after game. Dick, who
was the cleverest of them all in using tools, and
especially his jackknife, busied himself in fitting
new handles into their two shovels. With these
and the bait pails for excavating tools, the three
who remained in camp toiled diligently in removing
the sand from their well.</p>

<p>Tom returned a little before noon, bringing in
game enough of one kind and another to keep the
company in meat for two days to come.</p>

<p>There was no sign of Dunbar and the dory as
yet, and as the rest were hungry, it was decided
that Cal should cook dinner at once, while Tom
worked at the well in his stead. The cooking occupied
a considerable time, and it was two o’clock
in the afternoon when the tired boys finished eating.
They had not slept since the earthquake at ten
o’clock the night before; they had worked hard
during the night in an endeavor to save what they
could of their belongings, and they had worked
still harder ever since dawn. Moreover, the excitement
had been even more wearying than the
work. Now that it had passed away and its victims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
had eaten a hearty dinner, the desire for rest
and sleep became irresistible.</p>

<p>Cal had made measurements and reported that
two hours more of digging, or perhaps even less
than that, would give them a water supply once
more. At Larry’s suggestion, therefore, the worn-out
fellows decided to sleep for an hour or two.</p>

<p>“We’ll do the rest of the well-digging in the
cool of the late afternoon,” he said between a succession
of yawns.</p>

<p>“Let’s hope,” said Tom, “that Mr. Dunbar won’t
get here and wake us up before we’re ready.”</p>

<p>“There’s not much danger of that,” answered
Cal.</p>

<p>“Why not, Cal?”</p>

<p>“You’d know without asking if you were as
observant to-day as you usually are. I suppose
you didn’t notice that the wind died out before
noon, and there hasn’t been a sailing breath since.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Tom, “and he’ll have to row
the whole way. I ought to have thought of that.”</p>

<p>“Well, please don’t apologize now. It would
only keep us awake when every moment is precious
for slumber. I give notice now that I’m asleep and
you can’t pull another word out of me with a corkscrew.”</p>

<p>When the weary fellows waked the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
was nearly gone, but before resuming their work,
and by way of refreshing themselves for it, they
went down to the beach and took a plunge into the
sea.</p>

<p>“No sign of Mr. Dunbar yet,” said Tom, who
was beginning to be uneasy.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Larry, “but we needn’t bother
about him. He’ll turn up quite unexpectedly when
he gets ready. He always does that you know.
What we’ve got to do is to finish our well in the
shortest possible time. So, on with your duds, and
let’s get to work.”</p>

<p>“You’re ‘mighty right,’ Larry,” said Dick.
“I’ve quenched my thirst with sour wild grapes
till my teeth have an edge like those of a buck-saw,
and I begin to crave some unseasoned water.”</p>

<p>“I imagine we’re all in the same condition,” said
Cal, as they hurried back to the ruins of the camp,
“and it is altogether well that we are so.”</p>

<p>“How’s that, Cal?”</p>

<p>“Why, stimulated by thirst and encouraged by
a sure prospect of reward, we’ll stop fooling away
our time and do a little real work.”</p>

<p>Two hours later there was an abundant water
supply in the well, and it had so far “settled” that
the boys drank it freely with their late supper.</p>

<p>When the meal was over they all strolled down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
to the shore again and listened for the sound of
oars in the direction from which Dunbar was expected.
Nobody had suggested this. No word of
uneasiness had been uttered, but every member of
the company was in fact uneasy about the missing
member of the group. After their return to camp
this feeling was recognized as something in the
minds of all. Presently Tom offered a suggestion:</p>

<p>“What do you think, Larry? Won’t it be just
as well to show a light down that way, in case he
should have trouble in finding the landing during
the night?”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea, Tom, but we’re so nearly
out of oil now&mdash;indeed, we haven’t any except
what is in the lanterns&mdash;that it must be a
torch&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Or a camp-fire,” suggested Cal. “There are
no sand flies to-night, and there’s nothing to keep
us here. Why not move down to the bluffs and
build a camp-fire there? Then we can sleep by it
and keep it going all night.”</p>

<p>This plan was carried out, but it resulted in nothing.
When the boys returned to their work of
rebuilding the shelter the next morning, Dunbar had
not yet made his appearance, nor was anything to
be seen of the dory in such of the waterways as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
were open to view between the mud marshes that
dotted the great bay or inlet in every direction.</p>

<p>But as the boys busied themselves with their work
on the hut, their minds were occupied and their
anxiety as to Dunbar was less than during the
night before.</p>

<p>When another day had passed, however, and still
Dunbar did not return, that anxiety became very
keen indeed. They built their fire again on the
bluff, and they tried hard to sleep by it, but with
little success. They would resolve to stop talking
and go to sleep, and for a few minutes all would be
quiet. Then one after another would grow restless
and sit up, or walk about, or say something that
set the talk going again.</p>

<p>Presently, when all had given up the attempt to
sleep, Larry made a final end of all efforts in that
direction by saying:</p>

<p>“You see, boys, this thing is really very serious.
We are all anxious about Mr. Dunbar’s safety, but
we’ve got our own to think about also.”</p>

<p>Every one of the company had thought of that,
but until now all of them had avoided mentioning
it.</p>

<p>“You see it isn’t Mr. Dunbar alone that is missing;
the dory is gone too, and if he doesn’t return
the dory won’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, and in that case,” commented Dick, “our
situation will be really very serious. We are here
on what is practically an island that nobody ever
visits; we are without a boat, and there is no possible
way of escape from here without one.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we build some sort of craft that will
answer our purpose?” asked Tom, hopefully.</p>

<p>“What with?” Larry responded. “We have
no materials and no tools except the one little ax.
There isn’t so much as a nail anywhere on Quasi
plantation, and if there were kegs full, we haven’t
a hammer to hit them with.”</p>

<p>“We might drive nails with stones,” suggested
Dick.</p>

<p>“We might if we had one of your Massachusetts
quarries to furnish the stones. But on all this
coast there isn’t a rock or a stone as big as a filbert.
No, we have no tools and no substitutes for tools.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” growled Cal, who alone was lying down
with closed eyes in an endeavor to get to sleep,
“and you fellows are doing all you can to wear
out the strength we need for the emergency by
profitless chatter, when we ought to be sleeping and
refreshing ourselves to meet conditions as they
arise. Don’t you see the folly of that? Don’t you
realize that you aren’t bettering things, but making
them worse?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>“The very worst preparation for meeting difficulties
is to fall into a panic about them. Besides,
there’s no occasion for panic or for melancholy
brooding; Dunbar may turn up with the dory safe
and sound. If he doesn’t, I grant you we’ll have
some problems to wrestle with and we’ll need the
clearest heads we can keep on our shoulders.
You’re doing all you can to muddle them.”</p>

<p>“But, Cal, it is necessary to face this situation
and think of ways in which&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s precisely what you’re not doing. Not
one of you has offered a single suggestion that is
worth while. Besides, this isn’t the time for that.
Troubles always look worse at night than by daylight.
The best we can do now is to make up our
minds to two things.”</p>

<p>“What are they, Cal?”</p>

<p>“First, that if we’re in a hole, we’ll find some
way of getting out of it, and, second, that it is
high time to go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Have you thought of any plans, Cal?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly; but I have some ideas that may
be worthy of attention on the part of this distinguished
company, if this distinguished company
will individually and collectively stop gabbing and
let sleep respond to the wooing of closed eyelids.
Silence in camp!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXXV</h2>

<p class="pch">AGAIN TOM FINDS SOMETHING</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> morning came all the boys admitted that
Cal had been right in saying that troubles exaggerate
themselves at night and seem far less hopeless
when faced by daylight. The situation was the
same that morning that it had been at midnight,
but it did not seem so bad. Dunbar had not appeared
and every hour that passed made it less
probable that he ever would return. But somehow
even that prospect did not altogether appal the boys
when they thought of it by daylight.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, their minds were greatly disturbed
as they waited throughout that day for Cal to unbosom
himself of the ideas and suggestions he
had promised to offer. They hoped he would do
so at breakfast, but he talked instead of plans for
that day’s work in rebuilding the hut. While they
were engaged in building it there was no opportunity
for him to set forth his views; they could
not get together to hear his plans without delaying
the work, and they were agreed that nothing must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
be permitted to interrupt that. They looked forward
to dinner as the opportunity he would probably
seize upon for explaining, but when during
that meal some one threw out a hint that that was
as good a time as any, Cal replied:</p>

<p>“We’ll wait till evening; we must give Mr. Dunbar
till then to return. If he doesn’t put in an
appearance by sunset to-day we may as well give
up looking for him. Then will be the time for discussing
the situation and planning ways out of it.
Now we’ll all get to work again.”</p>

<p>There was something in Cal’s manner and in his
general cheerfulness which comforted his comrades,
though it would have puzzled them to say how or
why. It was evident at any rate that Cal had not
lost hope. It was obvious that he saw nothing in
the situation that should suggest despair, and his
manifest confidence was in some degree contagious.</p>

<p>The sun was still an hour high when suddenly
Cal called out:</p>

<p>“Suppose we let it go at that, boys. The thing’s
good enough as it stands and we can get on with
it for the few weeks that remain of our stay at
Quasi.”</p>

<p>“Then you really see a way out?” asked Larry.
“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Come on over to the bluff and we’ll have a last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
look for Mr. Dunbar. If he isn’t within sight we’ll
give him up and make up our minds that we shall
never see the <i>Hunkydory</i> again. Then we’ll talk
the thing over and see what is to be done.”</p>

<p>They set out for the bluff, restraining their impatience
to hear what Cal might have to say with
a good deal of difficulty, and only because they
must. They knew he would say nothing until he
should be ready, and that if they hurried him he
would remain silent the longer.</p>

<p>No sign appearing of Dunbar or the dory, Cal
sat down with the others and seemed ready to say
what was in his mind.</p>

<p>“This is a situation that we didn’t reckon upon,
but it is by no means hopeless, and we shall enjoy
talking about it as the crowning event in our trip
to Quasi when we come to think of it only as a
memory.”</p>

<p>“But we’re not out of it yet,” interrupted Larry,
“and I for one see no prospect of getting out.”</p>

<p>“There speaks despair, born of pessimism,” Cal
smilingly said. “‘Hope springs eternal in the human
breast,’ you know, and my breast is altogether
human and hopeful. But let us suppose your despair
is well founded, and see what then. At worst
we shall not starve to death. There is plenty of
game&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and fish too,” Tom interjected.</p>

<p>“Yes, and fish too. It won’t be easy to get
them without a boat, but we’ll manage in some
way.”</p>

<p>“We can easily make a raft to fish from,” suggested
Dick.</p>

<p>“I had thought of that,” resumed Cal, “but it’s
impracticable.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Because we have no anchor and nothing that
will serve as a substitute for one. Of course the
tide would quickly sweep our raft away from any
bar we might try to fish upon. No, what fish we
get will have to be caught with the castnet at low
tide, and in the mouths of sloughs where mullets
feed, particularly at night. But there is game, and
there are oysters, and no end of crabs. We shall
not starve to death. We have no bread left, and
Tom’s sweet potato patch is about exhausted, but
we can live on the other things for the two or three
weeks that we must stay here.”</p>

<p>“You’ve said something like that several times,
Cal,” said Larry, with a touch of impatience.
“What do you mean by it?”</p>

<p>“I mean that this is the beginning of September;
that the college session will begin on the first of October&mdash;less
than a month hence; that our honored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
parents expect us to be in attendance at that time; and
that if we don’t get home in time to pack our trunks
they will send out and search for us; and finally,
that as Major Rutledge, of Charleston, whom I
have the honor to call father, knew in advance that
we intended to visit Quasi on this trip, Quasi will
be the place at which he will first look for us. So
we’ll have our little frolic out and it will be great
fun to tell the fellows at college about it after we
get acquainted with them.”</p>

<p>The spirits of the boys responded promptly to
Cal’s confident prophecy, which indeed was not so
much a prophecy as a statement of simple facts
known to all of them, though in their half panic-stricken
mood they had not thought of them before.</p>

<p>Presently Dick had something to say that added a
new impulse to activity.</p>

<p>“Of course, Cal is right, and we’ll be rescued
from Quasi before the end of the month, but I for
one would like us to get away without being rescued.
Think of the alarm and distress our mothers
will suffer if we do not turn up in time, especially
as this earthquake has happened. They will think
we’ve come to grief in some way and&mdash;I say, boys,
we simply <i>must</i> get away from here before they
take the alarm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>“We certainly ought to if there was any way,”
said Cal, “but of course there isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” answered Dick, confidently.
“You’re the pessimist this time, Cal.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead and tell us your plan,” responded
Cal. “I’m always ready for the hopeful prospect
if I can find it. What do you propose, Dick?”</p>

<p>“To build a sort of catamaran. It can’t be
much of a craft because we have no tools and no
fit materials, but these waters are so closely land-locked
that all we need is to make something that
will float. We can paddle it to the village up there,
ten miles or so away, and from there we can walk
to the railroad.”</p>

<p>“So far, so good,” said Cal, when Dick ceased
to speak. “Go on and tell us the rest.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why the ‘how’ of it all. What is the plan
of your catamaran, and how are we to make it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be sceptical, Cal, till you’ve&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m not sceptical&mdash;not a bit. I’m only asking
what we are to do and how, so that we may get to
work at it early in the morning, or to-night, for
that matter, if there’s anything that can be done
by fire light. You spoke of our parents awhile ago,
and of the alarm they must feel if we don’t get
back on time. I’ve been thinking of my mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
ever since. She’s an invalid, you know, and a
shock of that sort might kill her. So I’m ready
to work by night or by day, or both, if it will help
to spare her. Go on and tell us your plan.”</p>

<p>“I will. You know, of course, what a catamaran
is, so I need not explain that. We will cut
two logs, about twelve or fourteen feet long, one
of them eight or ten inches thick and the other a
mere pole. We’ll hew their ends sharp&mdash;boat-fashion&mdash;and
lay them parallel to each other,
seven feet or so apart. We’ll fasten them securely
in place with stout poles at the bow and stern and
amidships, binding the poles in place with limber
vines. That will complete our framework. Then
we’ll place a light pole longitudinally on the cross
braces and about three feet inside the larger of our
two logs. From the log to this pole we’ll construct
a light deck of cane on which to stand as we paddle
and push the craft along. Of course it will be
a rude thing, very hard to manage, but as no part
of it will be in the water except the two logs&mdash;one
a mere pole&mdash;it will offer very little resistance,
not half as much as a raft would.”</p>

<p>“No, not a tenth,” answered Larry.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Cal. “We’re burning daylight.
This job is yours, Dick, and you are to
boss it, but I’ll be foreman of the gang and keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
myself and the rest of you at work. We’ll let supper
go till after dark, and utilize what’s left of the
daylight in cutting cane, vines, poles and whatever
else you need. Then we’ll be ready in the
morning to cut the logs and begin the work of
construction. Hoop la! We’ll be afloat again before
the week’s up! Dick, you’re a dandy, and
I’ll never accuse you of pessimism again. ‘Look
up and not down, forward and not back, out and
not in, and lend a hand.’ Dr. Hale put all there
is of sound philosophy into that one sentence.”</p>

<p>After the darkness made an end of work for
that day the boys sat down gleefully to their supper,
and hopefully laid plans for the morrow.
Presently Larry jestingly turned to Tom:</p>

<p>“It’s your turn now, Tom. You are credited
in this company with something like a genius for
finding things at the critical moment when we need
them most. Why don’t you bring your abilities
to bear on the present situation and find something&mdash;a
chest of tools or a keg of nails, or something
else useful?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I will,” answered Tom. “Anyhow,
I’m going out now to see what I can find in three
traps I set yesterday. There have been coon tracks
over that way every morning recently, and the gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
who made them may have walked into one
of my traps.”</p>

<p>The boys kept a number of torches ready for
lighting, now that the lack of oil rendered the lanterns
useless, and taking one of these with him,
Tom set out to inspect his traps. He was gone for
so long that his comrades were wondering what
had become of him, when suddenly he appeared,
coming from the direction of the bluff, though he
had gone quite the opposite way.</p>

<p>“Did you get your coon?” asked Larry.</p>

<p>“No,” said Tom; “but I found something.”</p>

<p>“What was it, and where is it?”</p>

<p>“Be patient and I’ll tell you about it. After I
had looked at my traps it occurred to me that I
might as well come back by way of the bluffs, on
the chance&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah, I guess it all,” interrupted Cal. “You
found the dory at anchor there and Mr. Dunbar
busy polishing his finger nails preparatory to his
return to camp. Or perhaps you found a&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop your nonsense, Cal,” commanded Larry.
“Don’t you see that Tom really has something to
tell us!”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Tom; I’m as mum as the Sphinx,”
answered Cal, who found it difficult to keep his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
jubilant spirits within bounds now that he had
something to do which promised results.</p>

<p>Tom resumed:</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it means anything or
not, but it’s interesting at any rate and I may as
well tell you about it. As I was passing the uprooted
catalpa tree, my foot sank into wet sand,
and as the sand there had always been as dry as
powder, I looked about to see what it meant. To
my surprise I saw water trickling out from under
the roots of the tree, and I went close up to inspect.
As I was looking at the new-born spring
my eye was caught by something curiously entangled
among the upturned roots of the tree. It
was so wound about by the roots and so buried in
sand that I could make out its shape only in part,
and that with difficulty. To make matters worse
my torch was burned out by that time, so that I
had only my fingers to explore with. I felt of the
thing carefully, and made out that it is a keg of
the kind that people sell gunpowder in. But I
could get at only a small part of the chine, so I
could learn no more about it. We can cut the roots
away and dig it out to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“We’ll cut the roots away and dig it out to-night,”
answered Cal, rising and lighting a torch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
“We have work to do to-morrow and can’t spare
time. Besides, this is a mystery and we sha’n’t sleep
till we solve it; grab a cold torch each of you and
come on. I’ll carry the little ax.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXXVI</h2>

<p class="pch">WHAT THE EARTH GAVE UP</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom’s</span> account of the way in which the powderkeg
was entangled in the roots of the catalpa tree
was more than borne out by the fact as the boys
found it. It seemed to them a wonder that Tom
had discovered it at all, so completely was it
wrapped up in the knotted mass of root growths.</p>

<p>After digging away the earth until the whole
root entanglement was exposed to view, the boys
set Dick Wentworth at work cutting away the roots
with his jackknife, a thing at which only one person
could work at a time. When Dick’s hand
grew tired, another of the boys relieved him at the
task and the work was hurried as much as possible,
not so much because it was growing late as because
the little company’s curiosity was intense.</p>

<p>“Wonder how on earth anybody ever got the
thing under the roots of a tree that way?” ventured
Tom, as he toiled with his knife.</p>

<p>“Simple enough,” answered Cal. “He didn’t
do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>“How did it get there, then?”</p>

<p>“Why, the tree grew there after the keg was
buried, of course. Somebody stuck a catalpa bean
in the ground directly over the keg. Probably the
man who buried the thing did that; he wanted to
provide a landmark by which to find the spot again,
and probably he knew there wasn’t another catalpa
tree on all Quasi plantation.”</p>

<p>“But that tree has been standing here a long
time&mdash;twenty or twenty-five years I should say.”</p>

<p>“That only means that the keg was buried here
twenty or twenty-five years ago at the least, and
’pon my word, it looks it.”</p>

<p>“What I’m wondering about,” interposed Larry,
“is what the keg contains. It must be something
important or nobody would have taken the pains to
bury it and plant a tree over it.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” argued Dick, “if it is anything important,
why did anybody bury it away out here
and never come back for it?”</p>

<p>“It all depends,” answered Cal, “on just what
you mean by ‘important.’ Things are important
sometimes and utterly unimportant at others; important
to one person and of no consequence to
anybody else. At this moment I feel that my
breakfast in the morning is becoming a thing of
very great importance to me; but I don’t suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
poor Dunbar, wherever he is, cares a fig about it.”</p>

<p>“By the way, what can have become of the
poor fellow? I wonder if he managed to fall out
of the dory and get drowned?”</p>

<p>It was Tom who asked the question. Cal, who
had thought a great deal about the matter, answered
it promptly:</p>

<p>“That isn’t likely,” he said. “Indeed, it is
scarcely possible. Dunbar was too good a boatman
to fall overboard, and too good a swimmer to
drown if he did. He would have climbed back
into the dory with no worse consequence than a
ducking in warm sea water.”</p>

<p>“What’s your theory then, Cal?”</p>

<p>“Why, that he has had one of his peculiar
‘spells.’ You remember that when he was missing
from camp the last time he wrote us a letter,
but when his lost knife was returned to him he
seemed to remember nothing about it. More than
that, he seemed to think the day he returned
was the same as the day he went away. In
other words, his memory was a blank as to the
time he was away. Then, too, you remember that
when we first found him here he couldn’t remember
whether he had come three weeks or four weeks
before. Still again, you remember how badly he
was mixed up about the date just before he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
away this time, and that too in spite of the fact
that he had important papers to post before a given
time.”</p>

<p>“Then you think he’s crazy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, because I’m not a
doctor or an alienist, or anything else of the kind.
But I think he has a way of losing himself now
and then, though at ordinary times his head is a remarkably
clear one.”</p>

<p>“I have read of such cases,” said Dick. “They
call it ‘double consciousness,’ I believe. I don’t
know whether it is regarded as a kind of insanity
or not. Then you think, Cal&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I hardly know what I think. You see I don’t
know the facts in this case. We know absolutely
nothing of what Dunbar did or what happened to
him after he passed out of sight behind the marsh
island over there. So we haven’t enough facts to
base any thinking at all upon. But it has occurred
to me that after he left us one of his fits of self-forgetfulness
may have come on, and it may have
lasted ever since.”</p>

<p>At this point the discussion of Dunbar’s case
was brought to an end by an unexpected happening.
As Tom tugged hard at one of the larger roots in an
effort to loosen its hold, the keg suddenly fell to
pieces. The oaken staves and headings seemed still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
to be fairly sound, but the iron hoops that had held
the keg together had been so eaten with rust that
they fell into fragments under the strain and the
staves tumbled together in a loose pile.</p>

<p>From among them Tom drew forth something,
and all the boys held their torches close while examining
it.</p>

<p>“What is it, anyhow?” was the question on
every lip.</p>

<p>“It’s very heavy for its size,” said Tom, poising
it in his hand.</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” answered Cal. “Lead usually
is heavy for its size. But that’s a box, made of
lead. If it were solid it would be a good deal
heavier. Open it, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I can’t. It doesn’t seem to have any opening
or any seams of any kind. Look at it for yourself,
Cal.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he handed the thing to his comrade.
It was an oblong mass, seemingly hollow, but showing
no sign of an opening anywhere. It was about
ten or eleven inches in length, a little more than
four inches wide, and about two inches thick from
top to bottom. The surface was much corroded,
but Larry thought he discovered a partly obliterated
inscription of some kind upon it.</p>

<p>“We must stop handling the thing carelessly,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
said. “Corroded as the surface is we might rub
the inscription off, and in that way rob ourselves of
the means of making out the meaning of the thing.
We’ll carry it carefully to camp, quicken up the fire
with plenty of light wood, and then make a minute
examination of the curious find. Tom, you may
have found a fortune for yourself this time, who
knows?”</p>

<p>“Or a misfortune,” suggested Dick, who in his
childhood had been a firm believer in all the mysteries
and wonder workings recorded in the Arabian
Night’s Entertainments, and still recalled them upon
the smallest suggestion. “Shut up as it is, with no
sign of an opening, who knows but that it bears
Solomon’s seal on it? The inscription may be Solomon’s
autograph, put there to hold captive some
malicious genie. We all know what happened to the
fisherman who let the smoke out of the copper
vase.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll take my chances on that sort of thing,”
laughingly answered Tom, who, as the discoverer,
was recognized by his comrades as the rightful
owner of the box and the person entitled to say what
should be done with it.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Cal. “Genii don’t play tricks
in our time and country. They’re afraid of the constable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys had reached the camp now, and a few
minutes later a pile of blazing fat pine made the
space around it as light as day. For an hour, perhaps,
the boys minutely examined the queer casket.
There was, or had been, an inscription cut upon its
upper surface with the point of a penknife, but the
corroding of the surface had so far obliterated it
that the boys succeeded only in doubtfully guessing
at a half-effaced letter here and there and in making
out the figures 865 at the end of the writing.</p>

<p>“That’s the date,” said Larry&mdash;“1865, the
figure one obliterated. Obviously the inscription
tells us nothing. What next, Tom?”</p>

<p>Tom was minutely examining the sides of the
case, scraping off the rust with his thumb nail.
Presently, instead of answering Larry’s question,
he cried out:</p>

<p>“Eureka! See here, boys! This box was made
in two pieces exactly alike, one top and the other
bottom. The two have been fitted together and
then a hot iron has been drawn over the seam, completely
obliterating it. It’s the nicest job of sealing
a thing up water tight and air tight that I ever saw,
but I’m going to spoil it.”</p>

<p>With that he opened his jackknife and very
carefully drew its point along the line where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
upper and lower halves of the casket had been
joined. After he had traced the line twice with
the knife point the two halves suddenly fell apart,
and some neatly folded and endorsed papers were
found within.</p>

<p>Tom began reading the endorsements, but before
he had run half through the first one he leaped up,
waving the documents over his head and shouting
“hurrah!” in a way that Cal said was “like the
howling of a demon accidentally involved with the
accentuations of a buzz saw.”</p>

<p>After a moment the excited boy so far calmed
his enthusiasm as to throw the bundle of papers
into Larry’s face, shouting:</p>

<p>“I’ve found the Quasi deeds! I’ve saved Quasi
to its rightful owners! Why don’t you all hurrah
with me, you snails, you dormice or dormouses,
whichever is the proper plural of dormouse? There
are the papers and it was Tom Garnett who found
them! For once prying curiosity has served a good
turn. Now, all together! Hip, hip, hip, hurrah!”</p>

<p>The others joined heartily in the cheering that
seemed necessary for the relief of Tom’s excitement,
and half-spoken, half-ejaculated congratulations
occupied the next five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>After that the whole party sat down to hear the
results of the more thorough examination of the
papers, which Larry was delegated to make.</p>

<p>“Yes, these are the deeds,” he reported, “uninjured
by time or damp or anything else, thanks to
our grandfather’s care in sealing that leaden box.
They were executed in May, 1861, and see, down in
a corner of each is written:</p>

<p>“‘Recorded in the clerk’s office of Beaufort District,
liber 211, pp. 371, 372, 373. J. S., Clerk.’</p>

<p>“And here’s a memorandum in our grandfather’s
handwriting and signed by him. It is on a separate
sheet, dated in February, 1865, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Read it!” suggested Cal.</p>

<p>“I will,” and he read as follows:</p>

<p>“‘The clerk’s office in which these deeds were recorded
at the time of their execution has been destroyed,
together with all the books of record. It
is vitally necessary therefore that these original
deeds shall be preserved. In these troublous times
there is no place of deposit for them which can be
deemed reasonably safe. I am sealing them in this
leaden box, therefore, and will bury them upon the
abandoned plantation of Quasi, to which they give
title. I shall plant a catalpa bean above them as a
sure means of identifying the spot, there being no
other catalpa on the plantation. I shall send my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
daughters a detailed statement of what I have done,
with instructions as to the way of finding the papers.
I place this memorandum in the box with
the deeds themselves, so that if anyone finds it he
may know to whom its contents belong. The address
of my daughters will be found endorsed upon
the deeds themselves.’”</p>

<p class="pch">TOM’S FINAL “FIND”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Tom</span>,” said Cal, taking the Virginia boy by the
hand and warmly greeting him, “you have crowned
this expedition&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother!” interrupted Tom. “You fellows
are daffy. I’ve had the good luck to find the
deeds, but it was by sheer accident, and anybody
else might have&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But ‘anybody else’ didn’t, and that makes all
the difference. Now listen. I have the floor. I
have restrained my natural impulse to do all the
talking lately until I’ve had to let out two holes in
my belt. I was going to hurl my best speech at your
head, but you interrupted, and now the graceful
periods have slipped from memory’s grasp. I’ll
leave the task of adequate expression to my father.
He’ll do it quite as well as I can. But there’s one
thing to which I must ask the attention of the company
here assembled.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Cal?” Dick asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, simply that Tom has added another to
the purposes with which this expedition was undertaken.
Our objects were sport and adventure.
We have had both, and now Tom has added a third&mdash;achievement.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” answered Tom, “but we
haven’t made the achievement yet. That will be
when we deliver the deeds to your father, and not
till then. And we’ll never, never do that unless
you stop your nonsense and let us get to work on
the catamaran, or raft, or whatever else you call
it. Our present job is to get away from Quasi
with the golden fleece. I suppose we ought to
sleep now, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But glue wouldn’t stick our eyelids together,”
broke in Dick. “Work’s the thing for us now.
Let’s get at it. Oh, I say, Cal, what of the tides?
When will they set in strongly toward that little
town up there?”</p>

<p>Cal reckoned the matter up and named the hours
at which the young flood tides would begin to run.
Then Dick thought a little and asked:</p>

<p>“Is it all land-locked water from here to the town,
or are there openings to the sea?”</p>

<p>“All closely land-locked&mdash;all creeks,” Cal answered.</p>

<p>“Then if we work hard we can have the catamaran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
ready by to-morrow noon&mdash;she won’t need
to be much of a craft for such waters&mdash;and we
can make our start when the tide turns, about that
time. Let’s see; the distance is only ten or twelve
miles, and the tide will run up for six hours. That
ought to take us there with no paddling or poling
except enough to keep the craft headed in the right
direction.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do it,” declared Cal. “Now to work, all
of us. Tell us what to do, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Let one fellow make a lot of fresh torches,”
the Boston boy answered. “The rest of us can
keep busy till daylight dragging bamboos, big cane
stalks and the cross braces down to the shore. As
soon as it is light enough in the morning we’ll fashion
the two larger timbers, and get them into the
water. After that two or three hours’ work will
finish the job.”</p>

<p>“An excellent programme, so far as it goes,”
muttered Cal, as if only thinking aloud.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Cal, what’s lacking?”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” Cal responded, “that every member
of this company is in the habit of carrying a
digestive apparatus somewhere about his person.
That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Right, Cal!” Larry broke in. “We must have
breakfast and dinner, and I think I remember hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
that experienced navigator, Richard Wentworth,
say, once upon a time, that one should never venture
upon salt water without carrying a supply of
provisions along.”</p>

<p>“I humbly submit to the rebuke,” answered Dick,
with a laugh. “It was forgetfulness, but forgetfulness
is never quite pardonable. Some one must
go for game immediately after breakfast. We have
enough on hand for that meal.”</p>

<p>“I delegate you to that task, Tom,” said Larry.
“Your habit of finding things may hasten the
job.”</p>

<p>It was a little past noon when the company pushed
away from Quasi on the rude raft that served them
for a ship, and were driven by the strong flood tide
through the maze of broad and narrow passages
among the marsh islands that lay between them and
the town on the mainland.</p>

<p>There was some discussion before they left Quasi
as to what they should do with the rifle and other
things in Dunbar’s log lockup.</p>

<p>Larry settled the matter, saying:</p>

<p>“We’ll leave his belongings just where he placed
them. We are not likely to find him now,
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And if he finds himself,” Tom broke in, “he’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
come to Quasi after them. Wonder where the poor
fellow is, anyhow, and what’s the matter with him.”</p>

<p>Nobody could offer a conjecture that had not
been discussed before, and so the subject was
dropped in favor of more immediate concerns.</p>

</table>

<p>The tide ran strong, and Dick’s “palatial passenger
craft,” as Tom called the raft, proved to be
cork-like in its ability to float almost as fast as the
tide itself flowed. About five o’clock the last of
the marsh islands was passed, and the little town,
perched upon high bluffs, appeared. As the raft
neared it, Tom suddenly called out:</p>

<p>“I’ve found something else! There’s the
<i>Hunkydory</i> riding at anchor in that little bay over
yonder! Now, maybe the next find will be Mr.
Dunbar.”</p>

<p>While Larry was sending a telegram to his father,
the others went to the boat and with permission of
the man in charge, examined it. No accident had
happened to it and nothing about it gave the least
hint that Dunbar had merely abandoned it. The
sail was neatly lashed to the boom; the mast and
the rudder had been unshipped and bestowed in
the bilge. Every rope was coiled and every pulley
block ran free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>More significant still was the fact that the lockers
were all filled with food stuffs.</p>

<p>“Obviously he intended to return to Quasi,” Cal
argued, “and laid in supplies for us as he had
promised. Whatever happened to him must have
occurred after that and just before the time he had
set for sailing. Let’s go up into the town and see
what we can learn about him.” Then pausing, he
turned to the man in charge of the boat and asked:</p>

<p>“Has she been lying at anchor and taking the
chance of rain all this time?”</p>

<p>“No,” the man answered. “She’s been in that
there boat house, but to-day the squire tole me to
anchor her out in the sun for an hour or two, an’
that’s what I’m a doin’.”</p>

<p>On their way they met Larry, who had telegraphed
his father both at the North and at Charleston,
uncertain whether or not the earthquake had
hurried his home-coming. In his dispatches Larry
had said:</p>

<p>“Quasi deeds found by Tom Garnett, now in my
possession and in perfect order. Dory sails for
Charleston immediately.”</p>

<p>Two hours later there came two telegrams from
Major Rutledge in Charleston, one of them addressed
to Larry and the other to Tom Garnett.
The one to Larry sent congratulations and asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
him to hurry home as fast as he could. What was
in Tom’s none of the boys ever knew. Tom’s eyes
were full of tears as he read it, though his face was
a gladly smiling one as he replaced the paper in its
envelope and carefully bestowed it in his pocket.</p>

<p>While waiting for these dispatches the boys made
diligent inquiries concerning Dunbar. He had arrived
at the town about three o’clock on the day of
his leaving Quasi. He had intelligently addressed
and posted his manuscript and drawings. After
that he had bought camping supplies of every kind
that the town could furnish, and had loaded them
very carefully into the dory. An hour later he had
been found sitting under a big tree and seemingly
in distress of some kind. He was unable to tell
who he was, in answer to inquiries. His mind
seemed an absolute blank. Papers found on his
person gave a sufficient clue to his identity and the
addresses of his nearest friends. Telegrams were
sent to them, and as soon as possible they came and
took the poor fellow away with them, a magistrate
meanwhile setting a deputy constable to care for the
boat and cargo till its owners should appear.</p>

<p>The young doctor whom Dunbar’s friends
brought with them explained to the old doctor of
the town that for many years past Dunbar had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
the victim of a rather rare mental malady, causing
occasional complete lapses of memory.</p>

<p>“This present attack,” he added, “is lasting
longer than usual. He has hitherto been allowed
to roam at will, to live in the woods and pursue his
investigations. Now, however, I shall strongly advise
his friends to keep him under some small restraint
for the sake of his own safety.”</p>

<p>“That ends the Dunbar incident,” said Larry
when the old doctor finished his relation of the
facts. “Now we must be off for Charleston.
What do you say, boys? There’s a moon to-night
and we might as well get a little start before it
sets.”</p>

<p>“My own judgment,” ventured Dick, “is that
as we worked all of last night, we’d better stay
here till morning and get some sleep. But ‘I’m in
the hands of my friends’ as the politicians say.”</p>

<p>Dick’s suggestion was approved, and the sun was
just rising the next morning when the <i>Hunkydory</i>
set sail. When the boys stepped ashore at the Rutledge
boathouse on the Ashley River, Major Rutledge
was there to greet them.</p>

<p>“We feared you boys might be in serious difficulty
down at Quasi,” he said, warmly shaking
hands all round for the second time, “and I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
about setting out to rescue you, when Larry’s telegram
came.”</p>

<p>“We rescued ourselves, instead,” Cal replied;
“and to us that is more satisfactory.”</p>

<p>“It is very much better,” answered the father,
catching Cal’s meaning and heartily sympathizing
with the proud sense of personal achievement that
lay behind.</p>

<p>“Come on home now, and over a proper dinner
tell your mother and me all about what happened at
Quasi.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap02">IN this volume Dave is back at Oak Hall and he brings about the
complete reformation of a former bully, who was rapidly going to the

journeys to the boundless west. At the ranch the lads fall in with
both good and bad cowboys, and the hero has a thrilling time of it riding
a “busting bronco.” Some horses disappear in a mysterious manner,
and while trying to get back to the ranch on foot two of the lads are
caught in a furious storm, that blows down a big tree on top of them.
There are many scenes of hunting and rounding-up of cattle, and once a
stampede adds to the excitement. Mr. Stratemeyer has traveled through

<p>The boys, after testing his patience in every

<p class="drop-cap02">THIS is a story of active boys of fifteen or so.
They are very fortunate in the friendship of
the principal of their school and his friend, an
athletic young doctor. Under the care of these
two they go into camp on an island well suited

thronged summer resort. A series of exciting
ball games and athletic contests with the boys
at the hotel naturally follows, and the boys display
as many varieties of human nature as could their
elders.</p>

misfortune, but has the pluck to try for a prize
which means a scholarship in college. It is very
hard for a lad of his make-up to do the requisite
studying, besides working and taking a prominent
part in athletics, and he is often in trouble, for,
unlike some others, who are naturally antagonistic
to the frank, impulsive Billy, he scorns to evade
responsibility. His four friends are loyal to the
fullest extent, and all comes right in the end.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
